service was mediocre at best,Gary Storer,03/10/2023,United Kingdom," Just returned from Chicago, flew out 10 days ago on American Airlines absolutely superb in every way, had high expectations on return flight with BA. What a disappointment. The Airbus A380 may be nice from a pilots perspective but as a passenger it was awful. Very uncomfortable seats, the inflight entertainment and flight tracker failed to work throughout the flight, the inflight meal was inedible and the service was mediocre at best. Our short flight from Heathrow to Manchester was much improved, very welcoming and attentive in flight staff and the flight even arrived early. In future we will travel with one of the American carriers.",A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Manchester via Heathrow,01/10/2023,no,Not Verified,2,2,3,1,2,2,-1
BA standards continue to decline,A Jensen,02/10/2023,United Kingdom,"  BA standards continue to decline every time I fly with them. This time, a 45 min late departure, which seems the norm for BA, and no information from the rude and clueless boarding gate staff. The Club lounge was overcrowded, dirty and grubby and cleaning staff could not cope. How many more cutbacks is BA going to apply before they become truly low cost. As a 35 year veteran user of BA, while people complained of Alex Cruz cutting costs, the past 3 years has seen them decline very quickly under their latest CEO. One reads the occasional article about BA improving things, but I have yet to see anything substantive. There seem to be few British staff left amongst the cabin crew, so maybe time for a name change and give the flag carrier status to a proper low-cost - and sadly the staff service has declined year on year. Onboard, the catering remains poor and surprised that Do&Co can produce such rubbish meals when I have sampled their Turkish Airlines equivalent in August that was superb - guessing BA are too tight with their budget. Onboard WiFi service is a joke and should be avoided.",A320,Business,Business Class,London Heathrow to Munich,01/09/2023,no,Verified,2,2,1,2,1,1,-1
"won the race to the bottom"" ",John Rockett,02/10/2023,United Kingdom,"  Awful. Business class check in queue just as long as for economy, probably because half of the desks were not staffed and Terminal 5 is chaotic. Business lounge overfull, couldn't get seats. Delayed flight, unmanaged chaos at the gate. No drink on boarding, first drink served an hour after take-off. The meal was poor, used to get better in economy on other airlines. British Airways has won the race to the bottom of the cheapskate stakes.

Not a reliable airline,Tatiana Bobrovskaya,02/10/2023,United Kingdom,"  Not a reliable airline. You cannot trust the timing at all. I had a 6.45am flight, boarding was on time, but then we are sitting in the plane for already (1.5 hours) and the expected departure is still not clear. They have discovered the engine is not working! I am risking to be late for a business meeting in Geneva. How come they bring a not working plane to the gate. The funny thing is that I had another business trip in spring 2023, also with BA to Amsterdam. When I arrived to the Airport that time - I was told I don't have a seat. I was put on the next flight in several hours, which should have get me to the business meeting late, but still not too much. A lot of stress. In the end, on the second plane we were sitting in the cabin for 1.5 hours and I have missed the meeting. I thought it was a dramatic unlucky case that time, but today I see it's routine for BA not to fly on time.",A320,Business,Economy Class,London to Geneva,01/10/2023,no,Verified,3,4,4,2,1,1,-1
Very disappointed,Tom Slowbe,28/09/2023,United States," The airplanes and the lounges are worn out, old and broken. From Dallas to Heathrow, multiple first class seating and electronics were non functional and poorly designed.

the service was shockingly bad,E Anderson,28/09/2023,United Kingdom," One of the worst experiences on the worst airline. The flight was delayed due to earlier technical issues. The time slipped from 17:00 to 20:00 to 22:00 and finally cancelled. There was zero information given. Despite paying well over the odds for business class, we were booted out of the BA lounge two hours before the flight. When it was finally cancelled, the BA staff. Without explanation, told everyone to go to a gate. After another hour or so they made us re enter the UK via passport control, a further 40 minute wait. By now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from BA. A passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags. BA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA rules refused to find us accommodation. Many slept in a bus stop overnight. There were people with young children who couldn’t find somewhere to stay and yet BA had closed down and left. The following day the replacement flight was also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a 2 1/2 hr flight. Overall the service was shockingly bad, the worst I have experienced from any airline. I will not ever use them again.",A321,Business,Business Class,London to Seville,01/09/2023,no,Verified,3,2,1,1,1,1,-1
not a single feedback from British Airways,Selcuk Benter,20/09/2023,Germany,"  My initial flight was cancelled 8 hours prior the flight. Then I was automatically rescheduled for next day. Next day, the flight was delayed leaving Hamburg and missed my connecting flight to Las Vegas. Me and several other passengers spent the night in London. British Airways provided us with vouchers but the transfer bus dropped us at the wrong hotel (closest to our hotel) and told us that we can walk there if we want to. As a result, I lost two nights hotel reservations that I made in las Vegas. I opened a claim and provided all receipts to British Airways to get refund of my hotel reservations, but over 5 weeks now, not a single feedback from British Airways.

Club Europe doesn’t feel very premium,41 reviews,18/09/2023,United Kingdom," Check in and security clearance very quick at LHR T5. My wife and I used the Galleries North lounge and at 6-00am it was easy to get a seat. Good buffet breakfast options. Flight boarded on time and flight departed on time. I was seated in 4 A, the Club Europe seats on the A320 seem to be getting smaller and legroom (I am 6ft) was very tight. Cabin Crew service was fine. I chose the full English breakfast, it was ok, but there was a lot of water in the bottom of the bowl. Flight landed on time.

service on board was impeccable,Peter Costello,11/09/2023,United Kingdom," Despite boarding being the usual free for all at LHR with groups 1-3 being called to board all at once. Whilst those passengers who had agreed to check in a bag in at the gate, getting to board before anyone else! However, the service on board was impeccable. Superb crew, friendly, attentive, interacting with passengers and generally appearing to be enjoying their job. Like BA in the old days and at its best. Food choice and quality seems to have improved too (no beef cheeks thankfully) and even the Club kitchen appears to have returned.

less than a premium experience,73 reviews,04/09/2023,Iceland," London Heathrow to Keflavik, Iceland in Business Class on an A321. British Airways provides an unusual Business Class experience for intra-Europe flights. The seating is similar to most airlines - middle seat vacant and little extra space - but on British Airways the Business Class cabin extends to almost half the aircraft. This makes it less than a premium experience at every step, from boarding to onboard. The WiFi worked for only half the flight and there are no refunds. But when it worked it was surprisingly fast. Service on this flight was very good and we got to Keflavik on time.",A321,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Keflavik,01/08/2023,yes,Verified,1,3,4,3,4,4,-1
"good, but not spectacular",73 reviews,04/09/2023,Iceland," Mumbai to London Heathrow in Business Class on an ageing B777-200. This aircraft featured the older Club World flatbed seats. They are comfortable, there is enough storage space around the cubicle, and the monitor screen is among the larger ones I've seen on airplanes. BA's new Club Suites are said to be far superior, competing with the best B-class rivals. The entire Business Class cabin had just 2 washrooms but it wasn't an issue on this flight since the premier section wasn't at full capacity. There was Wi-Fi on board, fast enough to even send videos via messaging apps. Service onboard was competent but the staff lacked warmth. The food was alright and no more. The biggest plus of this flight is that it gets out of Bombay at 1:10 pm in the afternoon instead of the ungodly early morning hours most international flights take off from India. The airport experience is far more pleasant at this time. In summary: British Airways provides a good, but not spectacular, Business Class product.",Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Mumbai to London,01/08/2023,yes,Verified,1,4,3,3,4,4,3
avoid BA like the plague,R H,02/09/2023,Australia,  Flying A380 business class should be a pleasure but BA has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable. How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy. Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised. The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position. There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping . The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of. The whole business class set up is a sick joke. Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off. Are there any redeeming features - the answer is no. If you like a little comfort avoid BA like the plague.,A380,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Miami,01/09/2023,no,Verified,1,1,1,2,3,1,1
British Airways absolutely does not care,May Porter,01/09/2023,United Kingdom,"  British Airways absolutely does not care. My reserved seat was change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight, full flight and it was quite awful. After enquiring at LAX check in, the agent said sorry, nothing we can do. Onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed, with meals trays passed out with no proper questions about choice. Then back and clearing trays and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hours after that. No water runs, if you need anything do not bother with the call bell, as they simply ignore it. I used to like travelling British Airways 10-15 years ago, but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier. I guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service. My last trip to London was with Delta, they are so much better than this very poor excuse of an airline that British Air has now become.",Boeing 777,,Economy Class,Los Angeles to London,01/08/2023,no,Verified,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
they are the worst in Europe,Rich Glasier,30/08/2023,United Kingdom,"  I flew London to Malaga on 27 August in Club Europe. We stood around at Gate B45 in Terminal 5 for over an hour, with staff giving very different reasons for the delay, late inbound aircraft etc - but the plane we boarded had been sitting there for more than an hour! After boarding, the captain stated that because they had changed planes there would be no meals served. This is Club Europe, and we received one small packet of crisps throughout the flight. No effort to apologise. We smelt the hot meal for pilots being heated and then saw it being served to them on a Club Europe meal tray. Cabin crew also had warmed pastries ( and were very quick to use air freshener in the front galley!) while customers received zilch. BA sent an email the following morning to say sorry - nothing else. What a complete and utter rip off by an airline that is already cutting back on so many things. I paid a full Business class fare, did not receive any part of the onboard meal service and they expect an email to be sufficient. Avoid BA if you have any other option nowadays, they are the worst in Europe.",A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Malaga,01/08/2023,no,Verified,6,1,1,1,1,1,1
appalling customer service,C Hill,28/08/2023,United Kingdom,"  Filthy plane, cabin staff ok, appalling customer service staff who couldn’t care less when dealing with a complaint. Paid extra for club Europe/business class. Food was poor, they gave you wipes to clean your seat area yourself and we were split up so they could accommodate families. Not really what you expect when you pay for the extra service.

"standards are worse than ever"" ",E Michaels,27/08/2023,United Kingdom,"   Chaos at Terminal 5 with BA cancellations and delays, and staff give different reasons depending on who you ask. 9 out 10 answers were lies. Sadly, BA airport standards at T5 are worse than ever, and we are long past being able to use Covid as an excuse. As a short haul club Europe trip, I expect very little from BA any more, and they barely even provide that, with cutbacks during Covid that are now permanent. If you can find an alternative carrier on the same route, choose them rather than BA.

"Nice flight, good crew, very good seat",6 reviews,26/08/2023,United States," Nice flight, good crew, very good seat, food was what you would expect. The aircraft had the new style Business Class seats/suite the actual plane as not new in any since of the word. There were parts of the seat that were broken or missing however the seat still sat well and worked. Seat was also long enough to really lay out and get some sleep. The video system worked great and had plenty of content. The headphones however were cheap and didn't feel or work particular good. The layout on this 773 had a lot of business class seats, a lot! We sat in the forward cabin (enter aircraft turn left) and that cabin is the quieter part of the aircraft. The crew was very nice and were there the entire time for any needs or wants we might have had. One draw back to the seats is as we were traveling as a couple the middle divider didn't open enough to really feel like you and your mate are traveling together. LHR is what it is, crowded and expansive but we had a good lounge visit and were completely on time for all flights.",Boeing 777-300,Couple Leisure,Business Class,LHR to LAX,01/08/2023,yes,Verified,1,4,5,3,5,4,5
ravioli pasta had dried out,1 reviews,24/08/2023,United Kingdom,"  Ground and cabin crew always provide good customer service. When it comes to catering, Club Class has been reduced to what Economy was. On flight BA621, the ravioli pasta had dried out along the edges. My slice of Camembert was dried- why bother serving it? My bread roll, white olive bread, was dry. I wonder whether anyone in BA monitors that. Club class has become Economy when you get crying babies and noisy children in Club class.

Great customer service,S Brydon,19/08/2023,United States,"  My family flew from Washington to London on a British Airways A380, we were able to secure seats on the upper deck for a pretty hefty fee. Our flight was unfortunately delayed by 2 hrs from 2245 to 0120 causing us to miss a connection from Gatwick to Turin and making it so that no lounges were open by the time we got to the airport. Onboard I sat in a window seat which had a nice luggage bin which was very convenient for all my stuff. In flight entertainment system didn’t work very well, the touchscreen was disabled and the controller was quite glitchy and hard to use, it could use updating. The food for dinner was decent, they had pasta with tomato sauce which tasted good by airline standards. The seat was pretty comfortable, and the flight was smooth. After we missed our connection and we’re stuck behind security for 2 hrs waiting for escorts, they rebooked us on a flight from Heathrow to Milan the next day, gave us free bus tickets to Heathrow, gave us a free hotel room, and gave us Dinner and Breakfast vouchers.

I was at the connection checkpoint at Heathrow 3hrs before my connecting flight, the last leg of my trip. An agent insists on checking in my hand luggage since my plane is full. And then they lose it. I claim it at the arrival airport immediately. Now it's been three weeks, no communication whatsoever, the online status is still “Searching for your bag” with no updates.

Couldn't recommend BA more,Andrew Ling,01/08/2023,Hong Kong,  I had the most fantastic BA Flight today. The cabin crew in my seat zone 6D were of the best I have experienced. Although the 777 had the old style rear/front seating - it was comfortable and felt open and spacious. BA have done great things with the menu - it was nice not to have to eat breakfast food on the pre-arrival meal into HKG at 1730PM local time having left London at 2200 the night before. The dinner offering was equally ample and delicious. The inflight entertainment had a great collection of TV and current films and the inflight map was first rate. Previously not a huge BA fan - but after this 12 hour flight I could only recommend it without reserve. I flew the new BA suite in J class on a recent Delhi to London flight and enjoyed that product (although I felt it slightly more cramped ) but I think BA have stepped up with really comfortable bedding and food and very friendly crew who engaged throughout the flight in the best way.

There was no lounge access offered. The boarding process was well handled. British Airways Business Class seats for the Club Europe product are terrible - exactly the same as Economy with the middle seat left vacant. You don't even get extra pitch.

pilot apologise at every step of the way,D Keane,21/07/2023,United Kingdom,"  Flight was delayed due to the inbound flight arriving late. There was no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updated. When ready to board we were requested to take our seats quickly to help reduce the delay, which people did. The pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff, so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork. After this was resolved, the pilot announced there would be a delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait again. So after rushing to sit quickly, we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly one hour, which is longer than the flight takes ! Of course AMS is not BAs home base and it uses contracted staff here, but it should require a better level of service, It was embarrassing hearing the pilot apologise at every step of the way.

The contract lounge is comfortable and spacious with a bar and pleasant staff but you have to pay for alcohol after the one free glass of wine. Food best avoided. On board, great crew and dinner was actually good quality and substantial apart from the ""chocolate and orange pot"" that seems to appear on every flight - have they bought up the global stock?

This really is all about getting from point A to B without what it used to be an enjoyable trip making experience.

made their economy experience so miserable,Alan Lacey,20/07/2023,United Kingdom,"  I'm sure that BA have gradually made their economy experience (BA Euroflyer out of Gatwick) so miserable that passengers are tempted to upgrade to the lacklustre and overpriced business class. Long wait at the biz checkin ( due to status ) and dealt with by a bored agent - OK third party, but still representing BA - who hardly spoke and avoided eye contact and was more focussed on her fingernails. Lounge was crowded and grubby but at least the staff there are pleasant and helpful On board the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two hours before crew appeared with food sales and the ""free water"" which on Gatwick services consists of a half full plastic cup rather than the luxury of a small bottle..

"Not recommended"" ",John Grainger,17/07/2023,United Kingdom,"  Our A380 developed a fault taxiing to the runway - we returned to the gate only to then have the flight cancelled about 3 hours later due to a technical fault. All the while, BA staff were virtually non-existent, it was finally the captain who announced the flight was cancelled. BA provided an alternative the next day involving a connection but it was very much take this or else you were on your own. No arrangements or help made with overnight accommodation or transport,  Finally managed to get the legal minimum £520 compensation out of BA for the 26 hour delay they caused to my journey, and expenses were reimbursed too, but even this took four weeks. The fact that as a Business Class customer BA pays the minimum they can get away with says it all - they couldn't care less about customers, have no interest in loyalty and aren't bothered about your business. Given its our flights that pay BA's way, I'd suggest to anyone they take their hard earned cash to another airline who might at least care less about their customers.

Things have really deteriorated,Pradeep Madhavan,09/07/2023,United Kingdom,"  My family and I have flown mostly on British Airways for the last 30 years. I am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name. They used to be a really good airline to fly with. Things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic. The aircraft look worn. For example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landed. The second time around, I think the reset was done for the whole aircraft. The touch screen function on my screen did not work. The USB charger ports on my seat did not work. The staff were pleasant enough, but their service oozed mediocrity.  There did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing. The food has been the worst part on our BA flights since the pandemic. They gave us a menu, asked what we’d like, did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else. They then told us that we’d get first choice at the second service which they couldn’t deliver on. Finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did, the food was tasteless. We take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this, to no avail. As a family of 3, we fly British Airways medium to long haul regularly, possibly 4-6 times a year each. For us, the good things about flying BA are that we are priority customers, usually have a direct flight to our destinations and get good service on the ground, when checking in and in the lounges when we use them.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Chennai to London ,01/07/2023,no,Verified,1,3,2,1,4,1,1
I will never fly this airline again,Jeffrey Rice,09/07/2023,United States,"  This has been by far the worst service I have had on a plane. It's very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of British Airways, they care very little about you. We had to wait an hour for them to even open the check-in. Once they did, they had 5 lines and only one that serviced economy. Even though the line for economy was three times the length of the premium classes. Then they told economy passengers that all bags had to be check and no carryon due to a full flight and no room in the overhead compartments. Once we arrived at the gate, there were not enough seats to fit everyone and you couldn't leave the boarding area.

short-changing passengers,Bervin Hedman,06/07/2023,United Kingdom, BA is not treating its premium economy passengers with respect.

Economy is absolutely awful,Alastair Cockburn,05/07/2023,South Africa,"  24 hours before our departure on BA059 to Cape Town from Heathrow on Thursday 29th June, we did an online check-in. Seats had already been allocated for my wife and I - 41 E and F - which are the middle two seats of the central block of four. These were totally unsuitable for us as we are in our late 70's and getting in and out of seats to stretch our legs or go the the toilet would mean climbing over a person on the aisle. But there were no other seats available. We got to Heathrow about 6 hours before departure and tried to change seats at check-in, to no avail, although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost. She did offer us an upgrade to Premium Economy but at 450GBP each it was beyond our affordability. She said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed. We spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympathetic. The economy seats are so tiny that I was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger, with knees touching the seat pocket in front. For 12 hours we suffered. When we did manage to get out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle, it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined backrest in front of me. BA Economy is absolutely awful. The evening meal was near-inedible - both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying, especially for an older person. The breakfast Spanish Omelette was, however, not bad at all. The previous day we had flown economy from Malta to Heathrow on Malta Airlines and that 3 hour trip was a pleasure. The seats are wide and there is ample legroom.

Boarding was chaotic,Carlos Whilhelm,03/07/2023,Italy,"  Airport check in was functionary with little warmth but some efficiency. Flight was delayed with no communication given. Boarding was chaotic and no management of the process by ground staff. Seats on board are tight and you really feel like they have crammed in every seat possible. There is next to no recline. However I was thankful that there was no recline. If the person in front had even the slightest recline they would be in my face owing to how tight the seats were spaced on this A321 aircraft. No amenities on this flight except for a toilet that was clean but small. No IFE, no food and beverage unless you pay extra but the staff were friendly.

preferred to fly on easyJet,1 reviews,29/06/2023,United Kingdom,"  Cairo is a 5 hour flight and BA considers it to be short haul, so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment. Not even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay for. You have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFi. Not that I have anything against that - I'm used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. I would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the price. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. And don't get me started on their customer service helpline. On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers. And for the flyers who don't want the hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a 'premium economy' option  and really make a difference for the experience. Heathrow Terminal 5 compounds the poor experience, especially for arrivals. It is also poorly served by transport links - especially for those of us who live near Gatwick which is being abandoned by BA. I have been a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a BA Gold Card holder at one point - so I know about the potential experience. I used be able to make the choice - do I fly budget, or do I fly more comfortably for more? Now it's a case of flying budget, or flying budget for double the price with BA.",A321Neo,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cairo to London,01/06/2023,no,Not Verified,2,1,1,1,2,1,1

stick with economy,R Vines,24/06/2023,United Kingdom,"  This is a two-for-one review covering economy and business class on the BA flight from London City to Ibiza. Economy was excellent. A very light lunch (small cheese-and-pastrami sandwich, chocolate brownie) followed by a pretty much free-flowing drinks trolley. The flight was full but the crew worked hard and did a very good job. This is a flight I would recommend. Except, don't fall for the last minute offer for an upgrade to business for £100+ in each direction, as I did. (I flew economy out and business back, while my brother flew business, then economy.) The business seats are identical to economy, with no seats blocked, so you are squished in four abreast. The meals are almost identical, with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your £100. The only real plus is Champagne. But on my flight, there was none because of ""supply issues"". The cabin attendant (I think his name was Tom) must be one of the best in the business. I didn't eat, so I paid £100 for nothing. Oh well. So great flight but stick with economy.",Embraer 190,Family Leisure,Business Class,London City to Ibiza,01/06/2023,yes,Verified,10,3,5,3,3,3,-1

Economy class seating was truly dreadful,14 reviews,20/06/2023,United Kingdom," Travelled to Heathrow to Kalamata and return journey 11 days later. World Traveller (aka Economy) Class. Both flights departed on time. Return flight landed early - BUT - we then had a 1 1/4 hour wait for the baggage to be offloaded which rather ruined the journey home as we then caught a motorway closure. Flights OK - FA's (particularly on return flight) pleasant enough. But, as usual, Economy class seating was truly dreadful - no legroom at all. No better in Club class either - only the middle seat left free. Marked down because of this.

Most uncomfortable flight,A Garlen,10/06/2023,United Kingdom,"  Most uncomfortable flight I have ever experienced. It's a long time since I have flown long-haul, the cramped conditions were awful. The rows were so close together when the person in front reclined their seat my TV was so close I couldn't focus on it.  BA seem to want to make economy so uncomfortable to encourage customers to upgrade, this has not worked on me, I will avoid flying BA in future. My onward flight was with LATAM, same 787 aircraft but more room between rows, far more comfortable. On the return flight from Santiago the lights were turned down at 8pm, I feel the cabin crew do this to avoid providing a service, they just disappear behind the curtains.",Boeing 787,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Santiago to London,01/05/2023,no,Verified,1,1,2,2,4,1,4
customer service was horrendous,Benjamin Stevens,06/06/2023,United States,"  May 3, flew from Seattle to Heathrow then to Edinburgh. BA lost my golf bag which caused me to purchase golf shoes, club rentals, tees, balls. I had tee times at two courses in St. Andrews that took months to make. The promised my bag returned in 24 hours and they would reimburse occurred expenses. I contacted BA and they state they would only reimburse toiletries. Then the return flight home was randomly canceled by BA without notifying me or without notice two weeks before the scheduled flight. I contacted the corporate travel team, they informed me BA, canceled my return reservation. They rebooked me on the same flight. BA customer service was horrendous and make false promises.

In flight entertainment offered a great selection of films and audio.

"the worst major European airline"" ",E Michaels,22/05/2023,United Kingdom,". The BA first lounge at Terminal 5 was a  zoo at 2pm, dirty tables and used tableware everywhere. Worse than this, the usual atrocious boarding gate service, and boarding started 50 mins late. The flight was operated by a Finnair A320, which is barely low cost standard let alone business class. Hard, thin, uncomfortable seats, poor legroom and the cabin was simply tatty - I remain shocked that BA allow this, and it's time for BA's CEO and management focused on standards rather than bean counting. Finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous, but they provide a very trimmed down, budget airline type service, as the whole trip turned out to be - and yet this business class ticket was one of the more expensive on recent trips. I thought post Covid that BA were better for a few months, but with the many cost cuts they are making, they fall well below all other European full service Airlines.",A320 Finnair,Business,Business Class,London Heathrow to Malaga ,01/05/2023,no,Verified,1,2,2,3,1,1,1
do not think the fare was worth the money,Steve Bennett,22/05/2023,United Kingdom," Paid a quick visit to Nice yesterday from Heathrow. Decided to go Business class since my last short haul flight in Economy was a real crush and rather unpleasant. I paid over £300 for a business class round trip. I went into the to BA lounge in Terminal 5 which was very crowded. Being 6.30 in the morning I decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering. The cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable. We subsequently discovered a much nicer BA lounge closer to the gate, B36, and waited there for 40 mins. Boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2A and 2C, seat 2B was blocked out, which acted as an additional table. There did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in Economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room. I think that BA are trying to outdo EasyJet in terms on no frills. It would not cost BA that much to supply Business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight. The inflight magazine is no longer available. There are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment. The inflight WiFi was flaky at best and non-existent at other times. I was glad it was only a two hour flight. I really do not think the fare that we paid was worth the money",A319,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Nice,01/05/2023,no,Not Verified,1,2,3,3,4,1,-1
most appalling airline service,C Peale,08/05/2023,Australia,"  I will never travel with British Airways again. I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UK. First, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out. This is the most appalling airline service I have ever encountered.

premium price for very average service,G Jones,28/04/2023,United Kingdom," Regarding the aircraft and seat: The business class seats on this flight were pretty good. All were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy. The downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interact. There is ample storage and USB charging ports. The seat is pretty comfortable. As someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times I've been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there. The amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. The leather toiletry bag was quite nice though. No slippers, only a pair of socks. The restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. No free Wi-Fi in Business Class is not acceptable. Another example of BA's penny pinching in recent years. Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor. Inattentive. Beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight. I had to go and find an attendant and ask. There was also no offer of any snacks. Rude at times. My partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. The attendant was incredibly rude in response. This left us shocked. Different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. A customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etc. whereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal service. This is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service. The food was pretty bad. I had risotto while my partner had chicken. Both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge. The vegetables were discoloured and flavourless. The bread was nice though. The breakfast wasn't much better. Summary: BA has become the Ryanair of long haul. The customer service is way below what I would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat. You pay a premium price for a very average service.

relentless BA cost cutting,M Edwards,16/04/2023,United Kingdom,"  LHR check in was quick at the First Wing and quickly through security. The First lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available. While BA have brought back their Highlife magazine in the lounge, it seems they used Covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer, as part of the endless BA cost cutting. The toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever, not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date (the public washrooms in T5 are better and cleaner). Boarding was the usual BA muddled mess, and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing. Endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight, requesting passengers to check in bags, only to get on a flight that was less than 40% full. Onboard a very good welcome from Captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late. Breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard. No hot towels or even packet towels offered in Club Europe any more, another part of the relentless BA cost cutting. I wouldn't mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre Covid. Cabin staff service was perfunctory at best, not a scrap of recognition for BA Gold or Oneworld Emerald members, clear proof that BA really don't care any more. Breakfast trays cleared 45 mins into the flight, and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight. Paid £4.99 for 1 hours wifi, and dropped connection for the next 40 mins. Sad to note that staff service on Ryanair is more pro active nowadays. Priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at Malaga, this is standard for BA business class baggage handling.

The most disappointing thing about BA is that aspects that really don’t need to get worse have. The check in staff at Heathrow are downright rude and abusive, shouting at passengers to line here and there and rolling their eyes if passengers get confused with the constant shouting and bullying. Airlines are now competing globally more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in Asia where the service industry is next level. I wouldn’t want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpful.

crew could not give a damn,N Melville,05/04/2023,United Kingdom,"  I have flown with BA for many years and there was a time about 10 years ago when they were getting better. Sadly this trip underlines how they have slipped versus other airlines. At booking time, one is scammed an extortionate amount to book a seat. At Heathrow T5 check in the queues were unbelievably long and staff at bag drop curt to say the least. The lounges here remain awful and overcrowded and BA has not invested in them for many years. On the flight the food was okay, although portions are kept minimal. This was one of those days when the crew could not give a damn and the service was mostly absent for the entire flight. Next time they change CEO, can they not do better than recruiting from aa second rate, budget Irish airline.",Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,London to New York,01/04/2023,no,Verified,4,3,2,2,3,2,2
a very solid experience,C Down,31/03/2023,United Kingdom," Boarding at Mumbai was chaotic and badly organised. Once on board the crew announcements were professional, relaxed and informative in typical BA style. The seat was quite comfortable. It was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good. I was lucky that the middle seat was empty so I didn’t suffer from the new narrow seat which I think would have made it a lot less comfortable. The IFE is excellent, responsive and good quality. There is an enormous selection of TV and movies and a good number of games. WIFI is also very good not quite Netflix quality but still reasonable and I don’t think £17.99 for full flight is bad value. You can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging. Cabin crew were very good. Friendly and efficient. Catering was reasonable although on a near 10hr flight, the small (but tasty) pastry for the second meal service wasn’t really enough. Landing and processing at Heathrow was astonishingly quick - it felt like it was 3am, even though it was 6:30pm! No queues or waiting at all. Even the baggage was super quick at coming through. Overall a very solid experience in economy. Significantly better than it used to be.",Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to London,01/03/2023,yes,Verified,2,4,5,3,4,5,5
"Service was impeccable"" ",Pieter Boone,30/03/2023,Netherlands," Mexico City Airport is a zoo, but taking the late departure on BA to LHR isn't too bad. Club passengers can use the AA Admirals Lounge, which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to BA's club passengers only at this time of day. Lovely staff, solid food & bar, really pleasant. We flew an older 787 with the old style club seats. Seated in the front cabin (just 3 rows of club) in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner. Come to think of it, I will really miss this old style -once cutting edge- lay-out. There is no better way to fly when you are a couple. We were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle. Still terrible you have to pay for these seats, but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats. Flying BA when the crew is good is amazing. Service was impecable on this flight. Just the right mix of humor, service and attention. Food seemed to be good as well, but hardly touched it. I am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better. On time departure, smooth flight and early arrival at Heathrow. We went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track. Security at LHR has always been terrible, but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without 'secundary' checks. We had a lovely shower at the 'spa', what a fabulous facility. The South Lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster. Who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture: what a mess! Food on offer was solid and so are the drinks. Our home stretch to Amsterdam was pretty straight forward. Lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent bar-cart service. I love the 'double'-servings of drinks. English tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and I really don't understand BA stuck to it through the years. No-one like the cucumber white bread things, but hey... On time landing in Amsterdam but the usual long taxi then clumsy jet bridge connection ended up with a 20 minute late arrival, why is it so hard to connect a jetbridge in Amsterdam? Flying club in BA is still wonderful. I Love it!",Boeing 787 / A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Mexico City to Amsterdam via London,01/03/2023,yes,Not Verified,2,4,5,5,4,5,-1
Generally poor,David Newman,27/03/2023,United Kingdom,"  Generally poor. Sent to gate on time, sat maybe 30 minutes, was then announced as crew were not familiar with the A321 there would be a delay. Clearly nonsense and there was a retraction on board of this statement. Watched the crew walk through to the gate, my impression was they did not want to be there. Was given a miniscule amount of water, small bag of pretzels and then it was announced there would be a wait for any further cabin service as card processing machines were u/s. No further updates or sight of crew for next two hours, then attempted to charge us for even a glass of water.

Very impressive and efficient,l Higgs,18/03/2023,India," First time flying with British Airways and first time flying to the Americas from India via London Heathrow. I chose Premium Economy at a reasonable price. I was quite comfortable, however, the first leg of the flight from Mumbai to Heathrow, the plane was a bit outdated and there was only a foot rest. The second leg, from Heathrow to Nassau, the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable. Cabin service was fine - I appreciated that they didn't come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping. The meals weren't that great to be honest. After landing in Heathrow, we had to wait on the tarmac for 45 minutes waiting for an open gate. My connection was less than an hour long! The BA staff in the Heathrow Airport helped me move through security quickly and I made it with time to spare for my next flight. When I arrived in Nassau, I found that my luggage didn't make it due to the short connection time in London. The BA baggage representative in Nassau was extremely professional and took down my claim. My luggage arrived on the next BA flight a few days later, and British Airways Nassau representative delivered it over to a charter airline which shipped it to the island I was staying on.

it's by no measure good,A Ahmed,15/03/2023,United Kingdom,"  
Our flight out to Dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from London Gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board. I understand why the likes of easyJet, Ryanair or Wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for BA given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone. Outbound LGW-DBV: Boarding was fairly quick, easy and efficient and we took off on time. Pilot announcements clear, professional and inspired confidence which is something I appreciate and expect of BA pilots. Aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'Pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort. Complimentary Harrogate Mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary snack of a Nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however. Cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-up. Toilets clean and maintained, appreciate anti-bacterial wipes being kept available post-covid. Inbound DBV-LGW: For some reason no online or app check-in available, despite Dubrovnik Airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities. No queue at manual check-in though, and ground staff were very warm, friendly and helpful. Pro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge, but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already. We did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time. Also we travelled to Dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening. All the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight. We boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason. It's truly bizarre how BA managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off. Pilots for this flight were unpolished, with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn't even remember where we flying back to! No apology for delay. Cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable. Harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary. Seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' ones BA are installing from row 14 onwards. These seats have barely any padding, so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable. We landed 55 minutes late in Gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours. We'd spent half an hour circling Gatwick because we missed our original landing slot. Given 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly BA as we don't fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences, but it's by no measure good, just the least bad option.

"Total disruption, wasted time",5 reviews,10/03/2023,United Kingdom,"  The incoming and outgoing flight was delayed because French Air Traffic Controllers were on strike so we were routed over Germany, and not BA's fault. O arrival the pilot announced we could not pull onto the stand as no ground crew had showed up to turn on the automatic last metre guidance. It took around 40 minutes to find someone. Then when that was done there was a further delay as there were no ground staff to operate the skybridge. All told we were trapped on the plane for over an hour within metres of our gate.

As my husband had spasms, he had to stretch his legs across my lap, and not once did ANY of the attendants ask if we were okay as we were clearly struggling.

"found the attitude appalling"" ",C Barton,18/02/2023,United Kingdom,"  My review relates to the appalling experiences I had with British Airways on 14th February 2023. I was due to travel to Madrid with British Airways and before setting off I heard on the radio that there were flight delays. I looked at the Heathrow Airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled. As a result of the information on the website, I called British Airways and have 26 minutes on hold I found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in South Africa. The person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled. I made my way to Heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled. The woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that “there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you”. She refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk. The same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to “go online to rebook your seat”. I am visually impaired and found the attitude of the BA employee to be appalling. I called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre. The person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport “must be wrong”. He then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that I would have to go and speak to IBERIA customer services in Heathrow to rebook! I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA. I returned to BA and this time I joined the check-in line and told a check-in agent what had happened. The man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes. He gave me a £30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline. The voucher proved useless I am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although I was told I could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it. Once aboard my new flight the service was minimal. Other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available. This was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight. BA Cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Madrid,01/02/2023,no,Verified,4,2,1,1,1,2,-1

I flew from PMI-LGW on 21/01/2023 and returned on 29/01/2023. Both Wizz Air and EasyJet offered very inconvenient flight times and charged more than the flights were worth for baggage. British Airways were the most convenient and best value option available, they offered ideal flight times and the €18 charge per flight for baggage was very reasonable - Total cost for both flights was €126 +/- Regular update information via email, seamless online seat allocation and check in. Efficient staff at the check in desks at PMI and LGW ensured that long queues were dealt with as quickly as humanly possible. Immaculate aircraft, comfortable leather seats with adequate legroom (I'm 6'4"" tall) Cabin crew were polite, friendly and professional. In flight food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced, I enjoyed the Meat Ploughman's and IPA beer (€10 -/+ total) on both flights I have flown 80+ times in the last 50 years with different airlines on various propeller and jet aircraft as well as one LGW-LHR helicopter transfer.

This flight was so disappointing,3 reviews,09/01/2023,United Kingdom,"  Flew ATL to LHR 8th Jan 2023. Was unlucky enough to be on board a 23 year old 777. Refit gave it a decent IFE screen and the seat looked decent. Although combine the IFE with the cheap and nasty earbuds, and any movie can be ruined. Headrest was great, just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my Wife and I were very uncomfortable. The leg room in general is poor, especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish. Zero room. Aircraft was tired. Rubber spacers falling out, silicone sealer falling apart in the toilets. Toilet seats old, stained. Rubber on arm rest was hanging off. No post take off drinks/snacks offered.  Meal was sent out after a couple of hours. Was poor. Chicken cubes that reminded me of dog food, mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life. Stale rock hard roll, salad which was rice and carrots?! Dried crackers with no cheese. Kids meal was just as sad. Tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck. Coffee creamer was given with the kids meal? Snack was decent for the adults, bagel with cheese and egg. Hot and tasty. Kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it.  Very very poor. Mix the food, BA service with a grunt, being crammed into a seat for 7 hours, landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and BA in my opinion, is terrible.

just an average airline,3 reviews,08/01/2023,United Kingdom,"  Great thing about British Airways A380 is the economy section upstairs. Get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats. Despite being not very old, the A380 looked tired inside. Broken side stowage, a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react IFE. The food was supposed to be Christmas dinner. 3 wafer thin bits of dry turkey, 4 over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes. Poor in taste and quality. Mousse desert was great though. Slight issue during the snack meal. Ordered a childs option which was marked as such. Regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same. Asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box. Staff were ok. Couple decent but mostly just ok. Overall, BA just seems a tad cheap these days.

the worst business class experience I've ever had,G Jackson,02/01/2023,United States," Probably the worst business class experience I've ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. This was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of four. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to ""upload my COVID documents"" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. After I filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any ""COVID documentation"" - I was informed (several hours later) that my ""COVID documents have been verified"". I then received another text message urging me to ""upload my COVID documentation"". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. Terrible, one might say. On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at all. Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. Meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the ""chicken or fish?"" type of meal selection similar to economy class. There was no coffee or tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a ""ploughman's lunch"" being downright disgusting. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. I won't comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. The seats are not 6' 2"" long as stated on the BA website, and I found the seats too short for my 6' 2"" height. The ""Priority"" luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery.","A320, A380",Family Leisure,Business Class,Vienna to Los Angeles via London Heathrow,01/01/2023,no,Verified,1,1,2,1,1,1,1
surprisingly a good product,31 reviews,02/01/2023,United Kingdom,"  BA shuttle service across the UK is still surprisingly a good product. When compared with BA long haul that doesn’t always get the best of comments at times. It’s reasonable priced, works well, fresh crews and no queues or long distances to walk. I don’t know why they still offer a COVID style bottle of water and snack when just stretching to a cup of tea and snack would be great add on for this service. Currently they have an on line sky cafe but it’s too fiddly to work or get connected in short trips.",A321,Business,Economy Class,London to Belfast,01/01/2023,yes,Verified,3,4,5,3,5,4,-1
Maybe the old charm will return soon,31 reviews,01/01/2023,United Kingdom," I must admit like many others I tend to avoid BA long haul where possible due to the many poor reviews. But had my first ride on a BA A380 the other day so it was an exception. What can I say. Aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but that’s about it. IFE didn’t work but wasn’t that interesting anyway. I got the map screenshot for a while. Lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it. Cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down. Some skirts, some trouser suits, some long sleeves some short. Some jackets some waistcoat. Some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better I think. Baggage delivery was really quick. Summing up well I am still not coming back to BA not yet.

having to pay to reserve a specific seat,Stephen Segar,30/12/2022,United Kingdom,"  When will BA update their Business class cabin - 8 across on a 777. It is not so much travelling facing backwards as it were, but the cabin staff having to pass food trays across the front of passengers paying business class fares! As for having to pay to reserve a specific seat - an antiquated idea. The cabin staff were fine, food acceptable, check-in OK and Business lounge (breakfast) acceptable. The lack of space in the seating area, small screen and disfunctional entertainment equipment disappointing.

Upgrade was worth it,5 reviews,29/12/2022,United Kingdom,  Paid £200 day before flight for an upgrade from economy to premium economy. At checkin they could not find my booking so a little wait while they rang someone who explains on the upgrade you get deleted from the system the checkin agent sees? Took about 5 minutes to resolve. Seat was nice enough. Stowage pocket in front a bit small. Food was reasonably nice. Shame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queue. IFE system is good but selection mediocre. Worst part of the flight is that at CPT so we were on a remote stand and bussed in. Through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight. Upgrade was worth it at £200 maybe £300 (its a long flight) but their offers of £2000 or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing. Score before the luggage fiasco would have been 7 or 8 / 10.

Disappointing meal,5 reviews,29/12/2022,United Kingdom,"  BA website did not work (weirdly deleted my flight from ""upcoming flights"" on the day of departure). Chaos at Cape Town airport with hundreds queuing as the computers were down. Chaos at the gate / no queue management for premium passengers. Very nice new A350 with smart new club suite. Champagne warm (cabin crew said its impossible to serve it cold, which is not true as Air France manage it). Disappointing meal, wine served so late after the food you have finished by the time it arrives. Cheese ice cold and tasteless (why can't the champagne / white wine be in the fridge used for the cheese?). Good IFE system but mediocre film selection. Disappointing breakfast. Overall: 3 / 10.

treat your customers like idiots,Amanda Edgar,22/12/2022,United Kingdom,"  Another BA Shambles. Started off well with excellent check in at first at t5, mid afternoon so avoided the early morning, evening scrum. Into the Concorde lounge, excellent service again. Great choice of cocktails, wine etc. Food ok a bit overcooked but pretty reasonable. Called to the boarding gate. Chaos, people jostling for position to get on the plane. People with children under 5 called before the 8 people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over 5. We get on to be told that none of the lights in first can be dimmed at all, so the lights were on all night. It was like being detained and interrogated! Excellent wine and champagne selection. Dinner menu handed out. I’ll have the prawn cocktail to start please. No you won’t as they’ve only loaded one for 8 people and the guy in 1A got it. I bet he felt like he’d won the lottery. Ok I’ll have the beef wellington, basically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce. Mains,  I’ll have the curry, no you won’t as they’ve substituted that with Christmas dinner.  I’m going to the Maldives to get away from Christmas. I ended up with short ribs that were inedible, no salad starter, no water offered, no bread roll. I just couldn’t eat it. So basically my husband and I have spent £20,000 on 2 return seats to be blinded by lights on and left starving. No apologies. Watch out BA as Virgin start flying direct in October.

cancelled only 4 hours before take off,Andrew Wilkes,20/12/2022,United Kingdom,"  BA cancelled my flight home to Heathrow on Dec 19th. On the face of it, that was sensible as the weather in Iceland was appalling. However, what was not acceptable was that the flight was cancelled only 4 hours before take off time by which time I was already struggling through dreadful driving conditions to get to the airport. I got nowhere near before the conditions became too bad. If they had taken advice they would have spared everyone the need to try and travel on roads that all ended up closed. I am now booked onto the flight on the 21st and downgraded for my sins. Having checked today, as I type they have not cancelled the flight on the 20th despite the road to Keflavík being closed!

improvements needed with their ground staff2,S Ward,14/12/2022,United Kingdom,"  British Airways are not the flag carrier they used to be. The check-in staff at the Club Europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service.  The Galleries South Lounge was very busy, but the food was very good. There is a good array of salads, pasta, bread, and hot food available. The festive Turkey and Ham pie was particularly good. The flight was delayed as LHR was very busy on a Tuesday evening. The boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate. Despite BA using a group system to board, it took almost 1hr to board 240 passengers. The flight itself was good, with a good Club meal service. The bar service was good but it seems that BA have done away with champagne on-board and also in the lounge. A menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight. The food was very good, with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen. BA have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed. The seat is a standard economy seat, with a table in the middle seat for Club Europe, a standard practice for BA. The seat was comfortable, but with limited leg room. The cabin was clean, presentable, and tidy with no issues. The A321 featured Wi-Fi which contains a very good landing page with flight information, access to the Speedbird Cafe menu, access to BA.com, and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also. Overall, the airline is still a good world player, but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff. The cabin manager was very good, but the other crew in Club did not display the expected behaviours in business class.

About six months ago BA announced they were switching planes to the old antique push-me-pull-you layout but it was too late to reorganise our holiday logistics.

learned my lesson about late BA upgrades,R Vines,10/12/2022,United Kingdom,"  When I tried to check in online, I was offered an upgrade to premium economy for just under £300. I decided to take it, but then the website wouldn't allow me to choose seats or to check in. I phoned BA and was happy that the call was picked up quickly, but I was then told that because I had changed my booking, I had to check in at the airport. So we turned up three hours before the flight, only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium. The check-in agent was helpful but couldn't fix and suggested we try the BA desk airside. That desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line, we were told to try at the boarding gate. At the gate, we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window, not sitting together. After going through that, the flight was surprisingly good, with decent food and very good service. We flew back economy, which wasn't too bad either. The flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic, and Emma and Daniel, who looked after us, could not have been better.

Couple of days later I flew back from LHR to Prague. Boarding at LHR T5 was a total chaos. Onboard service cannot really be called service: No curtain between business and economy class (which later caused people endlessly passing to get to the toilet). Meal service could not get more unprofessional - 5 rows took two guys nearly 30 mins to serve. Constantly interrupted (no people passing to the toilets at this time yet). I don´t know if there was any meal choice as no one bothers talking to you. I was served that  afternoon tea consisting of three canapes-like bites and some drink. Why would we bother serving you also a scone. Hardly after 5 mins plates to be taken away - when I asked for my scone it came as a surprise I was not served any (no co-ordination between the crew).

Initially my flight was delayed in Denver by 3 hours. As such I knew I would miss my connection in Warsaw. The Denver to Heathrow flight was terrible. The plane was dirty, I was in economy, I usually fly business or Premium Economy but on this flight there was no availability. The plane was only about 2/3 full and the service was not good. My food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable. When i arrived in Heathrow it was a complete circus. Passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections. Not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections. After waiting in line for an hour I was finally rebooked on another BA flight to Warsaw. This plane was the smallest 3x3 plane I have seen. Packed in like sardines. My bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to Miami. BA has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in Miami at some point and I can retrieve it from there.

I had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me. No apology. No offer of a napkin. I had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket. None of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal. Because the seat before me was so tilted, I could barely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off.

LHR T5 smooth and calm. Checking process quick. - But boarding card would not scan at security, they gave me one for someone else to a different destination.  Ran back to checkin to get correct one. Bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared.  Someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of T5 and retag them (amazingly they did show up in Cape Town).  Told only main lounge was open not B and C pier lounges. Turns out this was false information ... B Pier lounge was open. But I was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out. -Arrived late to the gate (train not working). There was a Biz class lane (quick) but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge, not two. Seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working. I was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting (imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink). Unbelievable that BA dispatches planes in this condition. Food average. Wine served way too late (choice of wine with cold food, or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later).

The meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time. On lading, we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good!

Staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed. They couldn’t get it out and away quickly enough. That was then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing. I sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service.

no attempt to provide fresh or hot foo,P Marten,25/10/2022,United Kingdom,"  Just a few years ago flying on BA was enjoyable, but times have changed. These days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. The Terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. On board though, it’s just become an experience to be endured. BA’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. There is no entertainment, no magazine. Refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. There is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. Is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? You get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. On the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. Recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. On the return flight, for one reason or another due to BA’s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew. The cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight. Altogether, I would say good things if there were any - but it’s hard to think of anything I could recommend BA for; and that is a pity, because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making European journeys.",A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Larnaca to London,01/10/2022,no,Verified,3,1,2,1,2,2,1

Baggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered and had no priority for Club or even First passengers; we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered.

Check in at T5 is poor, most of their kiosks don't work well and staff have to be called. Boarding was very poorly managed. The ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers. The gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft. The flight was full and it left 50 minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue. Once airborne, service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful. They did their job very professionally and efficiently. They answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble. They started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good.

Very rude and unhelpful staff,Ben Mallinson,22/10/2022,United Kingdom,"  We boarded our flight at Edinburgh to London for our connecting flight to San Francisco on 4th October, there were a lot of Americas heading back to America from Scotland because of the Open Golf at St Andrews. The woman at the counter was rude, I was actually embarrassed to be British at the time. Shouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her. On the flight from London to San Francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, I spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to America. Once we boarded, it was evident that the seat I was sitting in was broken. The recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. I asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that I was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn't recline. I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken. After all my experiences with BA, I will not be using them again. Very rude and unhelpful staff and I will chose another carrier in the future, im actually ashamed that BA treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for Great Britain.",A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to San Francisco,01/10/2022,no,Verified,1,1,1,3,1,1,3
All in all BA was just fine,14 reviews,17/10/2022,United States,"  LHR-LAX. I prefer the Boeing 777 over the A380 as the seats don't seem too cramped. Check-in was very easy with the kiosks as was bag drop and security at Heathrow. T5 is a whole other story. Once through security its up the escalator, up the stairs, up the elevator, down the escalator get to the gate, no seating, then down an escalator and finally down the jet bridge to the plane. I have been in and out of Heathrow many times but never in T5 before. Anyway cabin crew were pleasant; drinks and meal service were fine. It was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all moving around most of the flight. The entertainment system was good with decent options, so I occupied my time with several movies. Nice landing at LAX. All in all BA was just fine.",Boeing 777-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Los Angeles,01/10/2022,yes,Not Verified,2,3,4,3,4,4,4
recommend BA's new Club Class,14 reviews,17/10/2022,United Kingdom,"  Flew back to UK from Miami in new Club World Suite - a huge improvement on the elderly Yin and Yang style Club World. Boarding easy. Took off 1/2 hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way back and landed on time. Very comfortable suite with plenty of storage for bits and pieces. Bedding and large pillow supplied. Attentive FA's - especially Anna who addressed me by name). However, let down by very average catering (not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife). And, sadly, once again a very poor choice of films on the IFE which let down the excellent 17inch touch screen. Refused to pay BA's extortionate pre-pay to book your seat fees, and still got 2 seats together. C'mon BA - do we not pay enough already to travel Club Class ? I can recommend BA's new Club Class and we will travel this way - if we can afford it - in future.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Miami to London Heathrow,01/10/2022,yes,Verified,5,5,5,3,4,3,2

it was an OK experience,14 reviews,06/10/2022,United States,"  DFW-LHR. Had an easy transfer at DFW from American Airlines to British Airways heading to London. First ride on an A380 left me with the feeling that this plane type won't ever be my first choice. Was seated upstairs where the cabin space seemed very roomy, but the seats and rows were very cramped. When the passenger in front reclined the back of the seat was 7 inches from my face and I had a real difficult time trying to view the seat back entertainment screen. The seat itself wasn't too bad but I felt squished and locked in. On a plus side, having a window seat gave me this nice storage area by my side. Ground staff were pleasant and cabin crew were really nice. Plenty of beverages offered and multiple water runs were made during the night. Dinner was rubbish as was the morning pre-landing snack. The entertainment system was very responsive and had a pretty good selection of movies, tv, music and games. All in all it was an OK experience and did get me to London on time and our baggage arrived safely, but I'm not sold on the A380. T5 at LHR is another story that will be in a different review.

cabin crew are usually exceptional,41 reviews,01/10/2022,United Kingdom,"  Check in at LHR T5 was very quick and queue for security short. We used the South Lounge which was supposed to be the quieter at the time, but was very busy and difficult for our group of 3 to get seated together. Flight boarded on time. Whilst this is only a short flight (35 mins) the service of the cabin crew was outstanding. Glass of champagne, Coronation Chicken Salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little banter.

I still found it underwhelming,45 reviews,25/09/2022,United States," The check-in process was smooth. I got access to the IGA Lounge which was nice, but not as nice has the Turkish Airlines Lounge. On board was what all this flight was about. This was my first time flying Intra-European Business Class, and though I was well prepared, I still found it underwhelming. First, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. There is no personal IFE, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. Meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago. I could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. Also, the 32 passengers shared one single WC, meaning a long line for the bath room, something I have rarely seen in business class. Arrived at LHR, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come. It finally came, of course, and the delay was more on the airport than the airline, but since BA is the main operator at Heathrow T5, such things will affect their reputation.",A320-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Istanbul to London Heathrow,01/09/2022,no,Verified,1,1,3,2,3,2,1
At least the food tasted good,45 reviews,25/09/2022,United States," This is my first time flying BA's new Club Suite, which, in my opinion, is very good. Flight to the US, including mine, departed from concourse C of Terminal 5 which did not have many shopping or dining options. However, it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy. The highlight is the Club Suite, which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy. Meal service was slow, and everything was served on one tray, all at once. I think now is the time for them to begin to get back to pre-pandemic standard.

Shocked at what he told us re the cabin service provided (or not!!) especially as my wife and I have used them many times a year for + 20 years of business flights from RSA, this our recommendation to him to use them for his holiday. My grandson had a coughing fit, so they asked (bell push) 4 times for glass of water - all ignored. Last one was told ""wait till drinks are served!"" Then when evening meal served - no food available for the 4 year old, which was pre-ordered online, they said nothing available and when my son explained it had been pre-ordered - the cabin staff supervisors response - ""prove it Sir"", that sealed it for us, if that’s the BA response to what’s seen as cattle class - it will permeate to our normal travel class, so our next booking will be an alternate.",Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cape Town to London Heathrow,01/08/2022,no,Not Verified,1,2,1,1,4,3,3

let down by chaotic check-in and boarding,Michael Little,18/07/2022,Australia,"  Three flights, London to Reykjavik return and Frankfurt to London. Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris. At Reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate -- passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor.",A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Reykjavik,01/05/2022,yes,Verified,1,3,4,1,1,4,-1

Overall a good flight,E Smyth,09/07/2022,United Kingdom,"  Check in and security at LHR efficient. Went to Galleries North which was busy but fine with good service. Left from B gates. Efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus. This was my first time on the club suite. Travelling with 2 children. BA moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in. It was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy. I liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product. The entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned. The menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable. Prior to COVID one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back. As it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but I doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out. The club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly. It was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. Part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it. The second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which I thought was quite good. On time arrival, prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly. We don’t tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise.

they have no idea where our bags are,J Gandre,06/07/2022,United States,"  Today, my husband and a friend flew from Dublin to London City Airport. All apparently went well from check-in through the flight. After that, the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom. We waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage, but neither my husband's nor mine came. I found a BA service person to ""help"" me. He told me that there were 60 bags checked and 59 on the plane.  I thought, one of our bags made it. Then, two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they, too, had not gotten their bags. So, I assumed the 59 out of 60 was some kind of interesting fiction. I was then told to file a claim on BA.com which we did. At this time, about 10 hours after our flight landed, the system says they have no idea where our bags are! Now, I've had bags not get on flights before - less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously (I usually fly United Airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info - e.g., ""Your bag was loaded onto the plane""; ""Your bag is on its way to baggage claim""). BA doesn't seem to have anything like this. In this case, again, it appears BA cannot even locate the bag.

cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service,Nigel Forfar,30/06/2022,South Africa,"  Departure was about 40 minutes late. The A350 we flew on was about eighteen months old. The seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back, it is a real challenge to get out of the seat. The screen becomes so close to your face it becomes difficult to focus on the screen. Audio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation, I gave up trying to watch. The cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service, it felt very disorganised. Felt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraft - felt unnatural. The overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flight. I tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wife's meal but no one responds - better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle. Nice aircraft for a two hour flight but no fun for close to eleven hours.

I guess BA has selected the lowest budget option,Kemal Can,24/06/2022,United Kingdom,"  The customer service of British Airways is really bad. You can't reach any call centre agent even after waiting for 30 mins. Now, I really appreciate Emirates and Turkish Airlines after facing BA's low quality customer service. Not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul (LDN-JNB) is really low quality. Other airline operators which are working with Do&Co for flight catering are way better than BA. I guess BA has selected the lowest budget option from Do&Co.

BA standards continue to slip,M Edwards,22/06/2022,United Kingdom,"  As a regular BA customer on European flights, it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip, particularly ground service at LHR and the atrocious handling of delays. Staff at the entrance to the First Wing was brusque to put it mildly, rude to be accurate. Flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure. 45 mins later, 4 late customers were allowed to board, and not a single PA or apology from the flight deck or crew. The benefit of low cost airlines is they they don't hang around for latecomers, sadly BA is in a time warp over this. BA pilots used to be some of the best for updating status, but this has dropped dramatically in the last 2-3 years. The food standards and choices in the T5 First Lounge are one of the items that have been improved post Covid. Inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray, only 2 choices by row 3 - with 32 passengers in Club Europe only 4 salad options were available. No printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers. It appears there is no supply control in place at BA. Food quality was okay, but while Do&Co supply this, the Do&Co meals on Turkish Airlines remain superior to what BA manages (I flew Turkish 10 days ago). Staff service was perfunctory, but no attempt to interact with any customers in Club Europe cabin. I end where I started, BA standards continue to slip.",A320,Business,Business Class,London to Malaga,01/06/2022,no,Verified,1,3,2,2,2,3,-1

BA are putting the 'economy' back in premium economy,S Gray,15/06/2022,United Kingdom,"  Feels like BA are putting the 'economy' back in 'premium economy'. Very pleasant, friendly and helpful cabin crew. However it was over two hours before food was served on this already-delayed 7.40pm flight. A single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service, and with the food you were offered wine only, but the crew 'could come back later' if you wanted something else - including water! I drank wine anyway but I wouldn't leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food. I've never experienced this on other airlines' premium economy products (I flew WestJet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded, then brought them to you before, and then with, your meal in glassware - brilliant! Air New Zealand do glass and use your name throughout). Water eventually came round after we'd eaten. As I say, the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed under-equipped, under-staffed or following poor procedures. Food was forgettable. In-flight entertainment was great and the screens large - unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens' brightness levels reset to their retina-searing default. Not fun on a night flight with turbulence. Loos on this Gatwick 777 were halfway down economy (which was pandemonium) or at the very back. The upside to this layout is that PE is next to the exit, so we deplaned very quickly. Check-in queue at Cancun took forever. Couldn't see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate. Grateful for priority boarding in this situation. Bags arrived OK at Gatwick, no delay. I continue to avoid BA unless using Avios for business class or where there is no alternative. BA's problems all seem so easy to fix - their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you, why aren't they equipped and given service procedures to match other airlines at this price point?",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Cancun to London Gatwick,01/06/2022,no,Not Verified,1,4,3,2,3,3,4

Overall it was a great flight,Daniel Cook,02/06/2022,United Kingdom,"  Recent trip to Boston, departing LHR T5. Ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the COVID entry requirements in the US, they were really friendly and personable. Very short queues for bag drop and security, I would say it took us 20 minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the UK at the moment. Boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within 30 minutes. Seated on the last row of economy I really appreciated the low density 3-3-3 layout in economy compared to the 10 abreast seating. Myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped. Considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the IFE box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other. The cabin crew were excellent, well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro-actively offered drinks outside of meal service. Meal service was very efficient with cabin crew pro-actively removing trays from people who had finished early, something that you very rarely see in economy. The food by DO&CO was exceptional, I don't think i've eaten so much on a trans-Atlantic flight in economy. It will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an out-station. Overall it was a great flight, helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by BA which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere. I would definitely consider flying with them again.",Boeing 777-300ER,Business,Economy Class,London to Boston,01/05/2022,yes,Verified,3,4,5,5,5,3,-1
Crew were good but lacked the personal touch,Ken Howie,30/05/2022,South Africa,"  Boarding on time, but unfortunately from ORT’s worst boarding gate, which obviously was beyond BA’s control. Crew were good but lacked the personal touch. Old style ying yang business class with total lack of storage space, and the 777 was showing it’s age. However we were told the aircraft was being taken out of service the following week to be upgraded to the new club suites. The cabin crew were good, food ok, wines a little disappointing.

I will never use them again,Wayne Connolly,30/05/2022,United Kingdom,"  Check in easy at BGI due to us checking flightradar24 and finding the flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours, no notification from the airlines so other passengers arrived earlier. Easy boarding in sequence numbers. Seat is a joke for 8 hour flight, no leg room on isle seat of 4, the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passenger in front reclines its even worse. Food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat (only choice Coca-Cola, water or red wine. The connecting flight from LHR - MAN was cancelled with no contact from the airline, I only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs, with no alternative flight provided. We had to privately book a taxi from LHR to Manchester for 4 persons as this worked out cheaper than the train. The outbound flight was also a farce, no mention of Terminal change at LHR from 5 to 3, so quick turnaround changing terminals was chaotic and stressful for older relatives travelling with us.

This time boarding was by bus and to a remote stand with no Aircon. Then on flight the the Wi-Fi was erratic and guests couldn’t order food or drinks. Then the card payment system didn’t work so we gave up on ordering. Finally at Malaga we were held up and not allowed to leave the plane as the bags had to come off first in case 'we' caused the plane to go unbalanced? Really?

worth the extra money for Premium Economy,5 reviews,09/05/2022,United Kingdom,"  This flight was not affected by recent problems with BA and I was quite impressed by the British Airways Premium Economy product in a new Boeing 787. Overall, Premium Economy turned out to be premium and clearly a step up from Economy towards Business Class. Also, the Premium Economy product came across much better in the Boeing 787 than in the old B747 or even than in the B777. Seat was very comfortable and had nice leg room.

discrepancy with the baggage allowance,Kirsty Henderson,29/04/2022,Botswana,"  We are on our way home after a 3 week holiday in the UK and have had all 4 flights with British Airways. Our 2 internal flights between London and Edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications, however, the 2 long haul flights have been a nightmare. Our initial flight from Cape Town to Heathrow was a full flight, the staff seemed very overwhelmed, they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the ""leftovers"", my entertainment system was also not working. We are about to board the return flight from Heathrow to Cape Town and the check in process was horrific. I had booked through Expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which I didn't realise until we checked in. I ended up having to pay an additional £85 for my bag, after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and I also spent 20 minutes on hold trying to get through to the BA customer service number with no luck. We asked to speak to someone is person in terminal 5 and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main BA terminal.  Overall it took us about 2 hours to get me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members, none of which could help me. There was also a discrepancy with the baggage allowance as my friend I am traveling with was allowed 26kg and after paying to add my bag I was told it was overweight as I was only allowed 23kg and the bag was 24kg. Compared to having flown with other airlines I will never fly with BA again, the level of service is shocking compared to what you would expect.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Cape Town,01/04/2022,no,Not Verified,7,2,1,2,1,1,-1
"food was first class, nothing was too much for the staff",W Gordon,28/04/2022,Panama," I connected into Madrid on Iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class service. British Airways short haul business class was in a totally different class. The cabin had 10 rows of seats in BC, a record for me. The staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight. The messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent. The food was first class, nothing was too much for the staff. Why, oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service? My thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company. British Airways keep up the good work, (it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your European competitors) overall you made me feel proud to be a Brit.",A321 Neo,Family Leisure,Business Class,Madrid to London Heathrow,01/04/2022,yes,Verified,1,3,5,5,5,4,-1

Check in was very fast and we cleared security in about 15 minute, we made our way up to the lounge which just has the basic essentials but was clean and spacious. When boarding time came we had priority boarding and was the first few to board, welcomed by the cabin crew and given wipes, once seated we left more or less on tme had the safety brief taxiing for take off. Once airborne it was soon time for the drinks and meal services, choice of 3 main meal options which was very good, served by very friendly crew, the captain kept us informed about the progress of the journey arrived at Heathrow slightly early.

BA have no intention of resolving this,Paul MacInnes,23/04/2022,United Kingdom," Business lounge was closed at Pisa airport which was probably beyond the control of British Airways but as it had been closed since January the least British Airways could have done would have issued their customers who paid for this service vouchers to be used at the airport, I complained about this to BA and as compensation they said they would credit my account with 10000 Avios points which I felt was an adequate compensation and at that point felt BA had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner. However that was seven weeks ago and no Avios points have been added to my account, I have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department, when the phone was answered I was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number I was calling! This scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now, it is clear that BA have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up, This airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers.",A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Pisa to London Heathrow,01/03/2022,no,Verified,2,1,1,1,1,1,1

Beverage cart after take off was prompt, followed by lunch with a choice of 3 entrees. Food can best be described as wholesome, but not meeting quality levels of Air France, Swiss or Lufthansa short haul business class meals. Menu is still missing, and like many other aspects of the experience, BA cut a lot during Covid and have not reintroduced. I wouldn't mind, but on European trips in 2022, BA are charging up to 3 times the fare levels of 2019, and the overall value for money is now very poor. The WiFi did not work from start to finish of the flight. Crew said it had worked on the way out and the Captain had contacted London to get it fixed on the return.

disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this,Nicholas Coveyduck,08/04/2022,France,"  The short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for. We chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the Club World Suits not the Ying Yang arrangement that they still offer. At the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago! Most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. As we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in Business Class we always lose out on the ""Points game"" but I take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. The points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us Bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us. This status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure, when they were still available, rather than the 24 hours when they were not available. On the long haul return flight I was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant. I asked if I could move and was told by the FA she would check. Nothing happened but after take-off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat. Judging by the interaction between them I would bet it was someone on Staff Travel. I think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this. Take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal. Had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it. In summary would I ever fly with BA again?

Easy check in, decent lounge experience except the very amiable staff were still forced to serve from behind barriers, very clean plane which left on time, ridiculous amount of legroom in 2D (it is a bulkhead seat but with lots more space than 1A or C), reasonable cooked breakfast served by a very attentive and capable CSM and arrived 15 mins earlier than scheduled.

old Club Class a huge disappointment,14 reviews,04/04/2022,United Kingdom,"  Flew back on BA0254 Bridgetown to Heathrow in the old Club Class. A huge disappointment after going out in the new Club Class suites - the end of this awful yin and yang seating can't come soon enough. Even tried to pay BA's extortionate pre-booking rate for our seats - none left to choose even weeks ahead. My wife and I were stuck in the middle 2 seats of 4 - 13E and F. Good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often. The March film selection so not good. Not particularly friendly FA who insisted face masks must be worn even though BA's policy has changed regarding flying back to a non-mask wearing destination (ie. London). Sort it out BA. Took off 20 minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight. Dinner not to bad but breakfast - fairly dire. My wife's smoked salmon bagel was dreadful. As usual when BA is good, it's really good but when it's bad it's awful. I recommend hesitatingly - come on BA, be great again.

Comfortable, big TV screen with high quality picture and good headphones, plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very private. Nice friendly FA's (called by my name from the off) and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served. Once again let down by a poor (at best) choice of movies on the in-flight entertainment system. Thank goodness the latest James Bond movie was showing. Took off and landed on time. Smooth flight.

you can and need to do better than this,Frances Firmin,02/04/2022,United Kingdom,"  Very poor flight from Cape Town to London. After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. Boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. The captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. This was no big deal. Then the captain announced that due to IT issues at Heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. With the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for Business Class but this was not forthcoming. In the event take off was permitted quite soon after. The crew had distributed menus but then did a PA to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. A drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. Drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. Dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. The food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. The cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. No top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. The flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. Breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. Coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. Cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. Come on British Airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes. For the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin.

The queue for the First Wing check in at 10am today was over 1 hour, and subsequent flight to Malaga 1.5 hrs late leaving the gate. Updated about the delays 3 times, but strangely not one person apologised or said sorry - BA seems to think this is normal practice nowadays.

packed-like-sardines Club World product,31 reviews,29/03/2022,United Kingdom,"  British Airways are in the process of upgrading all its 777 fleet to the new Club Suite, but BA59 had the 16-yrs-old, packed-like-sardines Club World product. The lounge at CPT was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived. On boarding, we were surprised to find that the menu, amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer. We suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of BA. Frustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline. The drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy. It's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth. Apart from a rather turbulent ride, the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule.

If I had the option I would not fly BA,S Sathe,27/03/2022,United Kingdom,"  Flew BA LHR-AUS on a 787-9 on the outbound leg and then back on the A350-1000 on the return leg. Seats comfortable. Staff service on the inbound leg was disappointing. Safety briefing was missed on LHR-AUS route. LHR-AUS boarding on time, flight flew out on time, landed on time. AUS-LHR boarding one hour late, left an hour late and landed one hour late too. Food quality on both legs was not fit for human consumption. Wife ordered a veg meal which was served cold on both legs. In flight entertainment on outbound leg was bad - 2/3 screens not working. On return leg worked fine, but this is due to the A350-1000 being brand new. Good quality of sleep on both legs, which was good. Check in at LHR was flawless and without incident. Check in at AUS was rotten. We queued and were number 4 in line and waited for 1 hour for staff to check us in. What was clear is staff quality in Austin is poor, passengers did not appear to have passenger locator form(s) ready / VeriFly app ready and / or vaccine detail ready. Having looked at business and premium economy class on both legs, paying business class and premium economy did not appear worth it. Baggage was received fine at AUS and LHR - the latter took ages on return.

really can’t believe they have the audacity to call this First Class,P Gough,19/03/2022,United Kingdom," I really can’t believe they have the audacity to call this First Class. The check in staff at Singapore were abrupt and unhelpful. The official BA lounge in Singapore was closed, so they’re using a cheap generic alternative, which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in. Suffice to say it was not pleasant. Onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch. I can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training. I had to ask for slippers. The first drink took nearly an hour to arrive, despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them. The poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine, which came filled to the brim. I mean it’s First Class, not a student house party. Neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu. Most of the food was awful. My steak was dry, over cooked and tough, and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately. I will say, the cheese and port were nice. However the worst thing was the constant galley noise. There was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat (1K) which they were in and out of all night, and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming. They also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat, so we’re in and out of that as well.

overall very medium experience,Thomas Kelly,18/03/2022,United Kingdom,"  London to Dubai. Family of 6 kids where from 10 down to 6 years old, savvy travelers, been on many holidays so we were excited to be on BA for first time. But disappointment became desperation as we had not eaten anything since Dublin that morning at 7am. We had no time to eat at LHR so thought we'll get something usually around 1 hour into the flight. 3.5 hours after take off they served out food. Food was fine but nothing special, no issues with beverage, no attention to kids as you'd expect from many other airlines, even a kids book would be good. Movies are all outdated and already watched.

First time using BA premium and likely my last,3 reviews,05/03/2022,United Kingdom,"  Flight took off two hours late after what can only be described as a shambles at the airport. No airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptable. The aircraft was better than the outbound flight, who screen was so small. After serving only about 2/3rd of the cabin, no first choice. Only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin. The airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why include it as a choice. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. A hot breakfast should be offered. With only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late arrival, I made staff aware. Whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first, there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight. It was a struggle to get my connecting flight. On arriving in Glasgow, got txt to say my bags did not make the flight.

smacks of continued cost-cutting,31 reviews,03/03/2022,United Kingdom," The economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight, with only about 30 passengers, but business class was three-quarters full. Boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on schedule. Sadly, BA59 makes use of the old Club World product, which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new Club Suite on BA42/43. There are some good points about the old Club World - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those, it's an embarrassment. The tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief. Service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current, overly cautious, post-Covid requirements, with everything served at the same time. This does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to BA's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting. Queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean. Arrival was on schedule, but Covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our baggage.",Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Cape Town,01/03/2022,no,Verified,1,3,3,2,3,3,1
continues to go downhill,B Malten,02/03/2022,United Kingdom,"  British Airways continues to go downhill. We flew business class and the experience was like economy from 20 years ago except you can have a glass of champagne. We were packed in full 3x3 seats because of IT issue the day before. Even if weren’t, the Seat pitch and width is the same as economy. Gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style. The food was dreadful. The in flight service was unsophisticated. BA used to have an acceptable European business class. They don’t any more. Other European airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison. BA is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs. How I miss the politeness of old BA business class from around 5 years ago, how I used to look forward to it, the small gestures like hanging up a coat, giving you a hot towel, having nice food, being served from the galley, rather than from the manky trolley.

scrapped the mandatory wearing of face masks,E Michaels,26/02/2022,United Kingdom,"  British Airways has scrapped the mandatory wearing of face masks onboard flights, although they pretend publicly that the policy remains. BA454 from London to Malaga on 25th February, and across 6 visible rows around me there were 7 out of 24 passengers wearing face masks - and I was one of them. This was long after the meal / drinks service had been cleared, and remained like that as we landed and deplaned. Cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisles and not a word was said to any of these non compliant passengers, or as they left the aircraft with staff bidding them farewell.

BA got everything right,E Smyth,13/02/2022,United Kingdom,"  BA got everything right. Allowed evening before check in , this allowed lots of time for staff to help with paperwork needed for travel to the US. On the day of travel it was half term and the Airport busy. In spite of this through security and into lounge in 5 minutes. Lounge clean, staff proactive and food served quickly. Good range of drinks. Easy transfer to C gates. Aircraft ready, boarding quick and well organised. Pre departure drinks served. The cabin crew were excellent and provided a very good service. The food was the new club world menu options ( roast beef) which was excellent. Although it was the older club world product it was clean and well maintained. On time arrival, baggage off very fast.

We had no issue with this, just enjoyed an extra days holiday but others might not have been so flexible. However, they overlooked rebooking our connecting flight from LHR and we were fortunate that there was still space on the flight when we checked in at ATL. The aircraft was newish and in excellent condition, flight was around 50% capacity. Service was excellent, staff were friendly and efficient. Dinner was good, breakfast was disappointing with little choice.

Performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard,31 reviews,25/01/2022,United Kingdom," Boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate. The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets. Performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons.

BA has a lot to do to regain its standing,John Prescott,25/01/2022,United Kingdom,"  Unfortunately having just flown in the new club world cabin this time we had an incredibly old plane. The good was the cabin crew who tried to make the trip as pleasant as possible. The bad was the in-flight entertainment, the screens were unwatchable when they worked, my wife’s didn’t, and post iPad era just don’t live up. The food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at once. Apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff.

Utterly appalling company,T Rigby,19/01/2022,United Kingdom,"  Utterly appalling company. We've flown with them two times now, and both times it's been a disaster. The first time: Return flight was delayed by over 24 hours. There was nobody at the gate to tell us this, so a large group of passengers had to roam round Dubai airport looking for BA staff. There were none. Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. We had no letter. They then put us on a bus to the other terminal. When we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. We were literally just left there. We had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. When we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms. We were given a terrible, dirty, cramped room. Several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved. Eventually we got to board the next day. My tray table was broken, as was the window blind, and I didn't get a meal. No compensation was offered. The second time I need to reschedule my flight. The website assured me this was fine, but provided no link. I needed to phone up. If you need to phone BA, don't even bother trying. I never got to speak to anyone, and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling. The food has been terrible, meagre portions given infrequently.

return trip was disappointing,Ken Howie,12/01/2022,South Africa,"  Return trip Cape Town to Durban in Club Class highlighted the inconsistency. Our outbound trip in December was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. Check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. The lounge was busy, but no complaints. We went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. With the price of good wines in South Africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. Lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested.

a pretty poor show by BA,R Teel,06/01/2022,United Kingdom,"  In Glasgow one check in desk open. Huge queue with no business check in. It took me close to an hour to bagdrop. Getting onto the aircraft in Glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting off.  I normally find BA cabin crew very nice. Breakfast was a very tired looking croissant.  I used the BA lounge in Terminal 3. Not very keen on the new table service. Poor choice and miniscule portions. Lounge staff were very nice in both directions. On arrival at LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social distancing. The flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. No priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in Pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was right. For the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time. I've never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. On board I gave the food a miss.  Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined.  Both cases were last off again. Club Europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin. I would have thought that BA would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is.",A319,Business,Business Class,Glasgow to London Heathrow,01/12/2021,no,Verified,2,2,1,1,2,1,-1
seats are a huge improvement,31 reviews,02/01/2022,United Kingdom," After two years of being unable to fly to our second home in South Africa because of COVID, it was fantastic to be back on board a BA flight to CPT, and in the Club Suite seats (1K and 2K) to boot. These seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. Storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old CW, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. The food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out. Cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. The flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time. CPT had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration.

Very nice return flight with BA,17 reviews,29/12/2021,United Kingdom," Very nice return flight with BA. To add to my previous review, I really like how BA organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups, this is super comfortable as 100+ passengers don’t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there. The A320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting. Row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very comfortable. Once again, amazing staff, and they were even more attentive and accommodating to Gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is needed. Lovely humus, beetroot and quinoa salad for food. Great WiFi at really competitive pricing + I think it is great that they also have food / alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes.

Overall a very lovely flight,17 reviews,28/12/2021,United Kingdom,"  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a ‘chic’ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was £200 one way (£600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.",A320-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Edinburgh,01/12/2021,yes,Verified,1,4,5,5,3,4,-1

They called families to the front but then decided to board business and premier classes first which I appreciate why but why call families? The worse seats ever and the legroom was appalling.

The cabin crew were a credit to the airline – smartly dressed, friendly and keen to please. We were offered two drinks before lunch was served, with more drinks with the meal.

BA hang your head in shame,James Goldie,23/12/2021,United Arab Emirates,"  I had low expectations of business class BA on European routes but this flight was even worse. T5 is a mess with 90 minute queue to check bags with tons of people arriving late. Check in guy seemed clueless about Turkey needs for pcr etc. BA lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant - there was mulled wine in crowded lounge but just bad all round. Boarding was chaos and we left an hour late. A320 was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free, you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat. There is no inflight screen no overhead screen. Although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back. The only salvation was a pretty decent shepherds pie and red wine otherwise I would avoid flying BA.

Airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the BA APP, we then had to join a line for the customer service desk, it took two hours to reach the desk in my case, on reaching the desk I was told I had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel. That did not meet my needs so I requested cancellation and to get my bags back, I was told to cancel my booking on the BA APP, they could not do it at the desk. I was then directed via a gate to collect my bags, this meant having to go via the UK border to reach a baggage belt, then I waited for my bags for 3 hours because they had automatically stored my bags for the following days flight. BA staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive, like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Aberdeen,01/12/2021,no,Verified,2,-1,-1,-1,1,1,-1
certainly make us avoid BA in future,Arthur Moore,16/12/2021,United Kingdom,"  It is first time we have flown BA business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last. Firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. It was manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. No complaints at all in that department. Food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, Business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, as are both the centre seats. We were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. You cannot see out. You cannot see other passengers. It was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. In most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space. We were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. Now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs, not some stranger. I am 5ft 10 and could just about manage. My wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind. The reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all. This is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid BA in future, if at all possible.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London Gatwick to Cancun,01/12/2021,no,Verified,8,1,5,3,5,3,2
British Airways happy to encourage the spread of Covid,M Edwards,27/11/2021,United Kingdom,"  British Airways seems happy to encourage the spread of Covid. Took the 7am flight from T5 at Heathrow to Paris CDG on 22nd November, which was boarded by bus from a remote gate. The bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load, standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full. The result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms! A second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it. It is shameful that BA ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the flight was okay, this serves to underline how BA seem happy to disregard any Covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment. In contrast, on recent Air France and Iberia flights, their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers. Maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to Covid that now prevails in the UK.",A320,Business,Business Class,London Heathrow to Paris CDG,01/11/2021,no,Verified,6,3,4,4,1,3,-1

The club Europe cabin was 12 rows of economy seats with the middle seat blocked off. For me at 5.11 tall, I can fit ok, however anyone taller than me might struggle with limited leg room. The inflight service was a a stop - start affair, nothing to write home about. The crew failed to work as a team. You had to go to the galley to get extra drinks.

an OK experience with a great cabin crew,Ally Wharton,24/11/2021,United Kingdom," Arrived at the South airport in Tenerife 2 hours before departure, Iberia had not opened the check in. Even with a full flight waiting, the usual check in process post COVID took place, with the usual errors in the paperwork slowing things down. Passing security was fine and Iberia had a lounge with 160 person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food. Boarding was done by a 15 meter long bus ride as the plane was parked at the gate. Not sure why. The plane was a very new A321 neo, with 14 rows of club seating. The seat was ok for a 4 hour flight, but anything longer and I would expect club Europe to have more leg room than the couple of inch’s between my knee and the seat in front. Food and drink where very good, served with steel cutlery and glass tumblers. Good selection of wine to go with a above average salad.

BA Silver card holder and no Stockholm lounge  to use. Boarding fine, but plane was worn out. Seats close together and row 30 even worse.  Crew really professional and happy it seemed. Arrival at Heathrow a total shambles. BA777 landed at 12.50, no gate so waited and waited for 25 minutes. Then BA jetty didn’t work. Then BA had no steps.

penny pinching by BA in club class,1 reviews,15/11/2021,United Kingdom,"  Outbound, seated in row 10, I was told they had run out of my chosen food option (shepherd's pie), so I had to settle for gnocchi. The steward had the temerity to blame the food supplier - as if BA could not get a better one! On the return, boarding from the back, not by priority, then, seated in row 12, I had the last half glass of champagne (only because one of the other passengers in row 12 had declined).

only just about recommend,14 reviews,15/11/2021,United Kingdom,"  Flew Club Europe London - Tenerife South 5 November and returned 12 November. Club Europe seats are not comfortable - you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of 3 empty to spread out a tiny bit. For the fare I would hope for at least a couple more inches of leg room - it would make a huge difference. We did at least get a meal (outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash) which were not too bad and a drinks service. However, on the inbound BA had no white wine - apparently there is a problem with their suppliers. Did not pre-book seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking. Just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes. Back to the flights: both in a new, or nearly near A320, both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect. Not a good check in experience at Tenerife South - just tacked onto the end of a large Tui check in queue. Also not a great lounge - the VIP lounge is merely adequate with OK seating for an hour or two. I would only just about recommend - there are still reservations about exactly what BA is trying to become.",A320 Neo,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Heathrow to Tenerife South,01/11/2021,yes,Verified,1,2,5,3,3,3,-1

Drop down menu to drop down menu not stating what I wanted to complain about. Would not even allow me to add tier points. The flight to London was marred with problems. In London we received an upgrade email to fast track and VIP lounges due to amount spent. This never happened and treated as paupers wherever we showed the email. We had to change planes to the other side of the airfield. The resort (Riu Paradise Beach) was riddled with bad food, drugs and bad attitude and when you complained you were fobbed off as they knew there was no BA staff to sound off too.

Flight left 20 minutes late but made up time en route. There were 13 rows to the business class cabin on this A321. Service was ok but it was quite expensive for the product offered. It’s a long sector and the food wasn’t great. Drinks were ok but the staff kept going on about a lack of glassware, not really interested if I’m being honest when we’ve paid a lot of money for it.

He was only doing his job of course, but we requested him to call a Supervisor. The Check in Manager, Goncalo Ribeiro, came to our rescue.  Not only did he identify the problem but spent half an hour of his time arranging a new supplier for our Day 2 test, uploading it onto our PLF’s, verifying our flight documentation and fast tracking us through check-in.

I am not a fan of the new NEO aircraft. Very cramped seating and uncomfortable. The armrests between seats are tiny thin and short in length and offer little support for two people and not enough for one. Aisle width seems smaller and going to the toilets at the back seems awkward. I have done a transatlantic on this aircraft with another airline and it’s not for me.

Who’d have thought BA could ever make Ryanair look like an attractive option,Oliver White,21/10/2021,United Kingdom,"  What has happened to British Airways? The whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. On the premise it’s due to covid precautions! They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! Apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they’re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. I’ve chosen and insisted upon BA for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, I also have not one but two BA Amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much I’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. In the last year I’ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to St Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. That cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! A couple of weeks ago I noticed that one of my Amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on Nov 12th this year so I tried to speak to them. As the World has largely been closed since March 20 I assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open, not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad English to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country I finally got through to someone at BA who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher! I’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect I will not spend another penny with this airline, I’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and I’ve cancelled my BA Amex. I work in the music business managing tours for bands so I reckon I book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that! Roll on the inevitable BA administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the Worlds Favourite Airline but now the most ridiculed.

Check-in was longer than normal,25 reviews,07/10/2021,United Kingdom," This was my first flight during the pandemic, so it was understandable the difficulties facing airlines. Check-in was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc. But on the return flight, it was a total mess. Just two counters open for economy and one for business. There were arguments regarding vaccine checks, where two BA staff were contradicting each other. It took an hour and ten minutes just to check in, resulting in the flight delay. On board, I was not expecting great service.  Seating was extremely uncomfortable, 29 inch pitch and 17 inch wide seats - just about bearable for an hour and a half flight.  On board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another, no eye contact with me just handed out. However, I was pleased that disembarking passengers were let out in groups, despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the aircraft is was still taxing to the gate.

ordinary BA domestic flight,31 reviews,03/10/2021,United Kingdom,  An ordinary BA domestic shuttle flight from Belfast to London Heathrow. Usually uneventful except for the cabin crew announcement three times advising people complete a UK passenger arrival form from the gov.uk website or risk prosecution. Some people challenged this statement and were rebuked. BA Cabin Crew were adamant that this was now a requirement. But the regular traveller amongst us knew this was incorrect advice. Some people were anxious departing the aircraft. Other than that crisp snacks and water were offered which is a nice touch.

our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by budget airlines,J Makin,02/10/2021,United Kingdom,  I’ve had to book six flights with BA recently. All have either been cancelled or had a significant time change. The latest flight was so late into Heathrow we missed our connecting flight even though we’d scheduled around 2 hours between flights. BA staff at Heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part. They couldn’t get us to our destination within 24 hours of our scheduled arrival time. We booked an easyJet flight from Gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to Gatwick. A complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far. Perhaps BA have a backlog of complaints the way they are performing at the moment.

The return flight again had no access to the club lounge, you pay for extras such as this as part of the business class ticket price and should by now be made available again (last 2 flight not available at NCE but this is more a part of the Covid experience).

decided to avoid BA from now on,4 reviews,22/07/2021,United Kingdom,"  I’ve been flying with BA for years and never had any issues. I recently had to arrange to have surgery in Budapest and naturally wanted to fly BA. So I booked my flights from BHD to BUD via LHR online on their site. Once booked I informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment. The very next day I received an email from BA telling me they had cancelled my flight to BUD but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier (a much earlier) flight the same day. Only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from BHD arrived. I would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue, but seemingly not… *interlude* To get into Hungary during covid one needs a valid reason, with medical treatment being one. I had to fill in a very confusing form on the Hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of Hungarian and pidgin English. Anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc, emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted. So I took the earlier flight but this meant I had to fly into London the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel. So operation booked, hotel booked, airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked, what could go wrong? Around three weeks before I was due to travel, BA, rather unsportingly, decided to cancel my flight to BUD again. Needless to say I was furious. I complained to BA customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel. Great excuse, only having looked at BUD arrivals info, Ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months. So BA’s covid excuse rang somewhat hollow. Epilogue: I got refunded most of my money from the flights I booked with BA, although they refused to refund my BHD - LHR flights because who knows? I also lost the money I had spent on a hotel and half of the money I had spent on booking airport transfers. Given the cavalier attitude BA seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that I lost a not inconsiderable sum of money, I’ve decided to avoid BA from now on.",A230,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Belfast to Budapest via Heathrow,01/07/2021,no,Verified,1,1,1,-1,1,1,-1

"uncomfortable, miserly experience ",1 reviews,22/06/2021,United States,"  I usually avoid BA because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges, but this flight was my only option. Note that BA actually charges for seat pre-selection in biz class -- 100 UK pounds in this case! Does any other airline in the world dare do that? I saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. The seats were BA's universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm's length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn't available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The ""bed"" is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. The cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest I've ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the £5,727 that BA charges for this route. I used miles to pay for my ticket -- but of course got whacked with BA's unique and notorious ""fuel surcharge"" fee of $636 for using miles.",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Mexico City,01/06/2021,no,Verified,2,1,2,3,3,1,3

It was good to see that check-in carefully scrutinised lateral flow certificates and passenger locator forms. Thanks to just 30 passengers on board, with more than half in Club Europe, the flight took off ahead of time. Service was a little perfunctory and the food was more reminiscent of economy than business class, with too much pre-packaging - the COVID effect, presumably. Arrival into T5 was also comfortably ahead of schedule, and although we were dreading many hours of queuing at border control, we were through the e-gates and collecting our luggage just 20 minutes after landing.",A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Preveza to London,01/06/2021,yes,Not Verified,1,4,3,3,5,4,-1

T5 was blissfully quiet, with no queues at check-in or security, and even the Galleries South lounge was less frenetic than usual, despite families with kids similarly desperate to escape Boris Johnson’s bully boy attitude. Ordering food and beverages from one’s table seems something worth continuing, avoiding all the wastage of endlessly replenished buffets. The flights was very quiet, with just 30 pax on board, 9 of whom were in Club Europe. Boarding by row also seemed a welcome improvement on the previous ‘groups’.

I was happy with the fast baggage check-in. This was a bus gate which is not my favourite thing but not a blemish on the airline. The COVID protocols are not as robust as they should be, particularly attendants need to be armed with sanitizer at the cabin entrance. There was a big mix up which I find inexcusable - I and another passenger were allocated the same seat on the same plane, causing a few anxious moments and the friendly attendant had to get me another seat but I don't expect such at this level.

not what you'd expect from a premium product,Jonathan Simpson,21/01/2021,United Kingdom,"  I was travelling back from Mexico City on a business trip. Fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment, which the staff do an admirable job with - but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of BA First at the moment. Firstly - no lounge at all at Mexico City Terminal 2. There's a paid lounge, but the check in staff wouldn't help with the details. Mexico City Terminal 1 has functional lounges for AeroMexico working. Not good enough for an expensive ticket. Finally got to board and the staff are incredible - but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come. The food was literally inedible in First and staff offered commented as much every time. So for an 11 hour trip in First the option really was chocolate or crisps. The first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention. The seat would not easily convert to a bed. It had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby. Again, not what you'd expect from a premium product. I left my watch on the flight in error and contacted BA immediately about this. Despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during Covid my watch was never found. BA has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers. Given that I told them specifically where I'd left the watch I can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it. All in all, you pay premium on a flight for additional service. BA isn't offering it at the moment. If it is essential that you have to fly really don't bother with first unless you have to - or go to another airline.

passengers with masks below nose,S Peale,09/12/2020,United Kingdom,"  Dubai to London on 5th December. Flight was ok - seat comfortable enough, crew reasonably friendly but my food was gross.  Both flights almost full with little social distancing and plenty of mixed groups sat next to each other. Lots of passengers with masks below nose or not on at all. When coming back to Heathrow many seemed to have below their nose. Announcement made at the beginning about masks. Crew challenged a couple of people at beginning of flight for not having them on or below nose but seemed to give up at the end. When leaving plane good number had already taken off yet nothing. On way back not a single maskless or incorrectly worn mask challenged. A guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight. He had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything.  Not like the crew were busy either, did 2 services the whole flight then rest of the time didn’t see them. Of course flying in these times is a risk but those risks can be reduced by passengers wearing masks, enforced by the airlines.",A350,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Dubai,01/07/2020,no,Verified,6,4,1,1,5,5,5

But this flight went ahead. Check in at LHR was fine, no fast track se unity at T5. Galleries South lounge open, they have an app system, it seemed to work well and my breakfast arrived quickly. Followed this with a shower (they are open-limited hours). Flight on time and well presented A321.

Everything I expected,Mateusz Walter,23/09/2020,Poland,"  I have always had great flights with British Airways but this time the experience was absolutely amazing! As this was my 100th flight, I decided to celebrate it in Club Europe, which turned out to be a perfect decision. The stewards working in Club made me feel special and delivered a professional and personalised service and were kind and chatty. Although the cabin crew was the best part of the flight, other features didn’t let me down either. Efficient business class check in at Warsaw, cosy executive lounge Preludium with attentive and helpful staff, well organised boarding (although no priority for Club Europe because of Corona). The aircraft was very fresh and clean. Seats were comfortable with enough legroom, adjustable headrests and power ports. The on board service is different than before Corona times but it’s still very good. Tasty lunch box from DO&CO with fresh chicken sandwich, oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse. The choice of drinks was wide, including a very good quality Champagne from Nicolas Feuillatte. All in all a perfect flight experience with British Airways. Everything I expected from this flight was fulfilled. The one thing I can complain about is baggage handling at Heathrow. We waited around 50 mins for luggage and they were also delivered irrespecutful of Club Europe priority.",A320neo,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Warsaw to London-Heathrow,01/09/2020,yes,Verified,9,5,5,5,4,5,5

We arrived at the airport at 7:00am, and the queue for check-in was incredibly long because some desks were closed. It took us over 40 minutes to arrive to a desk, and when we arrived we were told that the check-in had closed (at 7:25am) and that we had missed the flight. British Airways staff did not offer us to jump the queue at anytime. The lady at the desk booked us on a flight to Athens instead, telling us that the costs to reach Santorini would be reimbursed. We had to book two tickets worth £200 for a flight to Santorini on the same day.

I filed a claim,31 reviews,27/08/2020,United States,"  My flight from Los Angeles to Paris via London was delayed due to late inbound aircraft due to mechanical and so I missed my connexion in London and arrived in Paris 3'25"" late and missed my onward connexion on Air France and had to overnight on my own dime in Paris. I applied for compensation lawfully due me through EC261 but their customer relations department refused by carelessly determining that my flight had arrived in London under the 3-hour delay window for compensation even though my final was clearly Paris and their CR agent acknowledged this. After I pointed out the error she ignored me so I filed a claim with the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution and BA sent them a defences. They claim I traveled on AF65 and arrived in London ahead of schedule. The truth is that BA at LAX rebooked and reticketed me on that flight however AF refused to accept me and my baggage unless I paid them a surcharge. So, BA then rebooked me on flights to have me arrive very late into Paris and misconnect and have to overnight there. I do not know which is more shocking that BA would lie to the authorities in order to support their indefensible position or that their agents do not know how to read a passenger name record's air history.",A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Paris,01/02/2020,no,Verified,9,2,3,2,5,1,-1
lack of social distancing,3 reviews,08/08/2020,Germany,"  I was deeply unimpressed with the lack of social distancing on my flight. The plane to London was 90% or more full, and no social distancing could be applied. A number of people wearing face masks incorrectly (over mouth or as a chinstrap) throughout the flight, and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack (small bag of crisps and 250ml of water).  It seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever. Also, only the absolute minimum of service which, given COVID, is understandable but makes the flight really boring - or not, since some excitement was provided by turbulence, with very little information from the flight deck. Disembarkation was chaotic to say the least but Terminal 5 was empty and vast enough to allow to finally distance. An upgrade for 89 Euros one was was available but it didn't seem to make sense.

The check-in and security were very efficient and the lounge (not belonging to BA) was clean but had a more limited range of food than I would have expected. Boarding was very quick and cabin crew were friendly and professional. I am a big fan of the iconic 747 but we flew out on one of BA's new A350's and this brought home to me that the 747 business class is looking tired and old in comparison.

stands out in many areas,Mateusz Walter,19/04/2020,Poland,"  London-Heathrow to Warsaw on 14th March. British Airways stands out in many areas of the flight experience, starting from check in and ending on the deplaning. Very friendly, smiling, chatty people throughout my journey, including the lovely captain, who gave all the information about delay, missed slot and new departure time. What is also really appreciated in those coronavirus times, he entered the passenger cabin before takeoff without any mask whatsoever and assured us, this aircraft is so modern and has such good air filters that we are safe here. The boarding procedure was very well organised (no chaos) with 5 groups boarding sequentially. I didn't try the paid Marks&Spencer on board service but I think it would be a nice touch to get some refreshments free. The one thing I can pick on is the cleanliness of the rear toilet.

lies and lack of informatio,J Meers,02/04/2020,United Kingdom,"  A journey of 2 halves. Before hand, multiple lies and lack of information from the BA website. They cancelled my flight but they weren't honest about what they had done and lied. They claimed that I could re-book and showed lots of flights - none were in fact scheduled to fly but BA claimed that they were full. Then my return booking completely disappeared and the website claimed that ""all journeys complete"". Website at no point gave any indication about how difficult it was getting to fly from the USA to UK. Impossible to get through to BA in London. USA BA much better - a total wait of 1 hour 40 minutes to make 2 calls. Staff at the call centre efficient and helpful. Chaos at Chicago as most passengers had American issued boarding passes for the BA flight to London and BA weren't accepting those boarding passes. No explanation for the change in policy. Everyone I saw merely handed in the American boarding pass and was given a BA boarding pass. On the plane the staff were excellent - as usual. Food was good - verging on very good. Breakfast a little small but tasty. I even got a 2nd cup of tea! Journey smooth with some sleep. I stopped flying BA for 10 years because the head office is so poor - the staff on the ground are good but BA as an organisatiion comes over as badly managed: e.g. over securing client's data, telling passengers what is going on, running a decent frequent flier programme, design of the business cabin (stepping over the legs of the next passenger to go to the loo!) and so on. I only fly BA because of the lack of choice on most routes - whenever there is an alternative I try that (not American Airlines which somehow is consistently poorer than BA).",Boeing 747,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Nashville to London via Chicago,01/03/2020,no,Verified,1,3,5,4,3,1,-1
use the travel credit by May 2020,A Lee,23/03/2020,United States,"  I booked my flights to the UK in May 2019 and had to cancel our trip to the UK on March 12, 2020 .. 4 days prior to leaving because a travel ban was going to start on March 16, 2020 and because I am older and have pre-existing health conditions, my doctor asked me to postpone our trip. The British Airways customer care associates I talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were non-refundable. Now the problem is, I need to rebook and use the travel credit by May 2020 for travel to the UK by May 2021 or lose all the credit from our trip. How can I make travel arrangements by May 2020 with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place? I understand BA has policies in place, but I cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with COVID-19. I feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline, my preferred airline is still British Airways. British Airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisis....and make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them. Whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non-refundable tickets should not matter, because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers, remember, there are many other airlines out there to choose from. The coronavirus is something that no one has any control of. I guess the bottom line is I think British Airways needs to put some common sense to their policy. I want to rebook and travel, but I am hesitant to this at this time.

Fast track security was fast, as expected. Galleries Club Lounge was pretty good, and not too crowded. Boarding was smooth with priority boarding honoured as usual. The crew were excellent and provided a very attentive service, with plently of drinks runs given the slightly longer distance of the flight.

Add in different languages and some degree of inebriation as you have a recipe for an unrelaxing experience. Thankfully, the upper deck of the A380 was more civilised, with an efficient, if slightly distant, cabin crew who ensured that everyone was fed and watered by 2 hours after takeoff, allowing plenty of time for sleep. Food was mediocre and I've given up expecting anything more from BA's business class product. The White Company bedding is more of a gimmick than a genuine enhancement, and breakfast has become rather perfunctory, with no pastries or bread apart from a solitary croissant.

very disappointing service,R Bowen,29/01/2020,United Kingdom,"  Las Vegas to Gatwick. A very disappointing service for Club World, it felt like I was travelling in economy (with attitude). Especially considering the very high cost of the flight (I've paid half as much less for business class returns to Australia). We got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass). My initial drink after take off was not what I ordered, when I queried it, I got a lecture on this was how it should be. No wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. Yes, I could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? Other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until I got up and went to the galley to ask. The good news is the food was good and well presented. Although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (I later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). We had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were being asked again at breakfast. Sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, I actually thought I had a fever (I was so drenched in sweat) until I spoke to a colleague who was the same. I'm used to flying ultra long haul with Middle Eastern airlines, so I'm used to hot cabins, but this was crazy. Only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. Combined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasant. No need to say anything much about the eight across seating as I know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years, other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window. I do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. I have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive. There is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. Being on the second aisle, we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so it wasn't quick. At no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general PA announcement. The seats I can forgive as they are being addressed, but the service was budget airline level. Really BA, you need to do much, much better. The ground staff in Las Vegas were fast, friendly and efficient. The lounge was something from the dark ages, all 1970's wooden panels.",Boeing 777-200,Business,Business Class,Las Vegas to Gatwick,01/01/2020,no,Verified,1,2,2,2,4,1,4
roller coaster of incompetence,R Gannon,28/01/2020,Sweden,"  San Diego to Stockholm via London. Had I written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten. But I realise this would be unfair- BA is a game of two halves. The inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago. The food in Club is excellent, the cabin crew attentive and professional, the pilots are the best in the industry and IFE absolutely fine. The Club World product is competitive with the better European airlines such as Lufthansa and streets ahead of most US carriers. The problems start when anything goes wrong - which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non-core routes. In my case, the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft (an ancient 747) going technical. Then a comedy of errors. First the hotel vouchers just said ‘Holiday Inn’. There are about 15 in San Diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc. Next, the replacement flights. The clunky app kept just saying error for some reason. Eventually the full website on a PC showed my replacement flights. But no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me, were confirmed or whatever. On calling BA they wouldn’t talk to me because I ‘failed’ security- I didn’t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company’s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used. The next day I went to take the replacement flights- Alaska Airlines to Newark then SAS to Stockholm. Despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane, I was pulled off minutes before takeoff. BA had not paid for the flight! A reservation had been created but no ticket issued. BA then booked me on a roundabout route back via Chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm, getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation. Later I spotted that the next BA flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online, why was I not on this? When I called they had no explanation and only agreed to ‘exceptionally’ change my flight again after I complained about all of the above. Finally, I arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence. In summary, when all goes well, BA is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job. But old planes, rubbish back office IT infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong. And bear in mind I was travelling in business class- who knows how they treat economy passengers.",Boeing 747-400,Business,Business Class,San Diego to Stockholm via London,01/01/2020,no,Verified,10,5,5,5,1,3,3

Since moving to the USA I've been flying BA more than in the past and overall, they provide a more than acceptable service.

The new menus and service offering are significantly better than in the past and the wine list more interesting. On this flight the crew were engaging and the food was good.

the service was good,Ishan Pai,25/01/2020,India,"  Mumbai to Boston via London. My flight with British airways was really good. The catering was excellent on both flights and even the service was good. However, some of the seats have very limited legroom due to the IFE box blocking space in front of you. Also, BA had misplaced my tennis racket which was checked in. They have a really weird policy that you can't carry your single sports equipment as cabin baggage and instead, you have to check it in. The ground staff was rude at Logan Airport in Boston. Also, they took a week to deliver my racket to my house even though it arrived in Boston 24 hrs after I had come. Even after contacting BA'S Baggage Customer Service, they were speaking rudely to me. They always tried to cut my call in like 2 minutes without even listening to my concern.

still consider other airlines,M Larson,22/01/2020,Canada,"  Toronto to Geneva via London. I stopped flying BA about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service. Apparently things have improved somewhat since, so I decided to give them another try. Overall, I was happy with my experience, save for two major gripes. On the plus side: I flew on new aircraft, which were comfortable, albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft (same with all airlines). Legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31"". Pilots were very good and informative, as always with BA. Quality of food on long-haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; I rather enjoyed the meals served, which were on nice large trays. The IFE was just about adequate, though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft. Cathay Pacific's is far superior. The two major downsides: 1. The new Basic Economy fare. It is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers. BA really need to get rid of it. Virtually everyone on long-haul has to check in a bag, so please just include it in all airfare types. If I wanted to be nickle-and-dimed, I'd fly to Gatwick on a charter airline. Also, not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriating. I was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty! This just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay. Thankfully, the lady at check-in changed it to a window seat free of charge after I asked nicely. 2. No complimentary catering on short-haul. Seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from Heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with BA and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, I resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. BA should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip. If BA would get rid of these two new features, I would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant. As it is, I would still consider other airlines.",Boeing 787 / A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Geneva via London,01/01/2020,yes,Verified,10,4,5,4,4,3,3

However our luggage was not loaded onto the flight, the second time this happened now with BA and despite a 13 hour flight, 2 hour stopover, and 1 hour flight to Paris BA did not make any effort to inform us at any time of the issue. Instead after travelling for around 17 hours we had to wait for the baggage to all come and clear before we realised ours was missing. Being a Sunday and most shops close at lunchtime that also left little time to buy emergency items and the despite knowing they hadn’t loaded the baggage they could not find a way to send it quicker than 24 hours after arrival meaning 2 out of 3 days in Paris will be spent without luggage.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Paris via London,01/01/2020,no,Verified,8,3,4,4,1,2,4

The food in Euro Traveller is unfortunately no longer free, however being in BA's Executive Club you can pay for the food & drinks with avios, which is very convenient. The only drawback I could find is a long queue to the bag check-in at Warsaw Airport - 3 opened check-in counters for approx. 200 people is rather not enough.",A321neo,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Warsaw to London,01/01/2020,yes,Verified,1,5,5,5,4,5,-1

I was really excited to fly BA since they changed the aircraft from Boeing 777-200 to a Boeing 747-400 which is known as the queen of the skies.  The flight attendants are very nice and professional towards passengers, they did their best to speed up the boarding process since both of my flights were full and we took off. Everything went well on my first flight and also flight time went short over the atlantic due to great tail winds. On my second flight to Mumbai, the flight attendants were polite and respectful and gave the best service. However, during the lunch service, they ran out of vegetarian food option and had to fetch for vegetarian food in other cabins and even give crew meals to passengers who were vegetarian. Overall, my both flights with BA were good. There are some shortcomings on their older fleet like lack of USB ports, Power Outlet, Old IFE, the IFE box in front of you that blocks your legroom.

could not fault one aspect of the service,B Edwards,11/01/2020,United Kingdom," 
Fantastic flight. Travelled solo from London Gatwick to Glasgow in British Airway’s Club Europe cabin and could not fault one aspect of the service. I arrived at Gatwick around 2 hours prior to departure. All BA Club World passengers are entitled to fast track security at Gatwick. This was quick and the staff were pleasant enough. The lounge at Gatwick was clean and modern and made for a nice relaxing start to the journey. Boarding was quick and the flight departed on-time and landed 10 minutes early, the crew were very attentive and friendly. The in-flight meal was delicious (I had smoked Salmon served with curried rice). Overall a really lovely flying experience.

disappointed by the service,Imanuel Caushi,11/01/2020,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Tirana. I was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight, because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy. Business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers, there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class, and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat, to three seats behind me. . The seats were the same seats you have in economy, the difference being that the middle seat is empty, thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats.  I encountered odd problems with the meal as well - the lovely cabin crew member notified me that I had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished. You are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service. Flight left on time and landed early. British Airways have in my opinion the  best inflight W-Fi service. For 10 pounds you get unlimited, very high speed wi-fi where you can stream YouTube videos.

How the pilot and team managed this in these conditions I will never now but it was a smooth take off an when through the clouds a smooth journey all the way back to Heathrow. Cabin crew provided excellent service. Being business we were lucky to have champagne and our meals were excellent. Veg shepherds pie and chicken curry both lovely. So just want to thank you BA.

When I got to the entrance we showed our boarding passes and I can only assume the lady must have overheard our previous conversation as my wife was asked if she was bringing me in as her guest. No warm greeting, just a job's worth high handed attitude. Neither of the BA reps bothered to check my boarding pass properly.

They gave our seats away on the return flight and would not address this after purchasing expensive business class tickets 4.5 months in advance to ensure that our family flew 12 hour flight together. The flight to London didn’t have the best service, most toilets were out of service. The beds in business class are the most uncomfortable of all business class I’ve flown.

You get what you pay for,D Corey ,10/12/2019,Ireland,"  London to Singapore. I was apprehensive about flying BA Club World after reading many negative reviews. I was however, surprised. Firstly, they are not on part with SQ or QR - but to be fair, I found them to be one of the most reasonably priced offerings. You get what you pay for. The seat while old, is perfectly comfortable with plenty of space. The window seats are best for privacy. I am tall and had no issues sleeping. In fact, I slept for almost 7 hours. The service and food out of London was top notch, fresh and plentiful, which is a welcome contrast to the tiny meals you receive on Qantas. Service was consistent, polite and very attentive. Drinks and water continually topped up. I was truly impressed The return flight's service was very average and quite sloppy but let’s focus on the positives!",A380,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Singapore,01/10/2019,yes,Not Verified,1,4,5,5,5,5,1

Overall a good flight,31 reviews,08/12/2019,United Kingdom,"  Johannesburg to London. The recently refurbished First and Club World lounge at JNB has failed to resolve the congestion when passengers from the two evening flights to LHR descend on it. There's more table space for eating and the food has improved, but poor acoustics mean intrusion on privacy. Crying babies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activity. Boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion about group queues. The predominantly young, mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on getting drinks orders muddled. The meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main course. The food itself wasn't at all bad - when it was finally served. The cabin temperature wasn't too hot and we both slept quite well. Arrival was ten minutes ahead of schedule and baggage collection was quick.

crew are so friendly,25 reviews,08/12/2019,Sweden,"  London Heathrow to Miami. Flying the Boeing 747-400. Unfortunately BA hasn't done much work on their first class on these aircraft. Seats are flat bed but you have that wedge in the front that even for my 6'1"" makes the beds small. And since it's so narrow your feet get clamped if you sleep on your side. These seats are Business class on for example Qatar Airways. And I still think a first class ticket should include WiFi! But as always the service excel and the crew are so friendly and helpful.

cabin crew where fantastic,Cameron Martin,08/12/2019,Australia," London to Sydney via Singapore. Flight left on time cabin crew where fantastic. Meals were great. Leaving London we had a chicken stir fry and landing into Singapore at 18:00 we were served an English breakfast which I can eat any time of day but wife thought it was a bit odd. At Singapore, all passengers had to disembark the aircraft while it was refuelled and clean. When re-boarding you had to go through a security check at the gate. We were on the ground in Singapore for 1hour 30min. 2nd leg to Sydney was great also food and drink service was great again. 23 hours long haul flight was comfortable.

utter nightmares,D Jonas,04/12/2019,United States," London to New York JFK. We were booked on Brussels Airlines, two of us, which cancelled the flight and rerouted us on BA. The flight BRU to London was fine but the transatlantic leg and Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 were utter nightmares. Never again will I go to or through Heathrow. However, this review is about BA's 747-400 to JFK an aircraft that was in such a sorry state that it should have been junked years ago. How does BA have the gall to call its service ""business class""? The seats were tiny and wrapped in plastic chicken coop partitions that rattled and even fell down on several occasions. Let me add that we faced backwards and looked at a filthy wall. Cabin service was friendly and the food was actually quite decent. Aside from that, I now understand why BA has such a horrendous and well-deserved reputation.

the shortage of staff,A Ward,04/12/2019,United Kingdom,"  The first thing is the shortage of staff. The business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side. It meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken. Unfortunately although they were pleasant, the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained. I asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there weren't any. I showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken. At the end of the flight I discovered the switch. Despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping. I had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times. There was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section I cannot understand why they  would not offer a third. There was Port on the menu but was never offered with cheese. Every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course. Many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal. Most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal I was ready for a mini snack. I am not a big eater but I was peckish. The layout of the business cabin is cramped. I am 6' and I could not stretch out. The seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers. This means no one has a easy seat. You either have to climb or be climbed over. I wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market. I travel on many airlines in business and BA is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one I would use. The centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Bridgetown the BA team didn't get any better. After one hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage I approached a guy wearing a BA tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders. I then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about 25 cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing.",Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Gatwick to Bridgetown,01/12/2019,no,Verified,1,3,2,3,3,2,3
lacks personalized attention,Everardus Hamans,02/12/2019,Belgium,"  Brussels to Bangkok via London. Club World from London to Bangkok on 17 Nov 2019, seats 15C and 15D. It was a Boeing 777, with a 2-4-2 seat configuration in the business cabin, which gives the cabin a crowded impression. The seats are comfortable, with a flat bed (+mattress!), good selection of entertainment, although a rather small screen. The food menu offers different choices of starters, main course and desserts. The food was disappointing, I had smoked salmon as a starter, and British Beef as main course. My soup was cold, mybeef was overcooked) and quantity was economy class-like. The service is very friendly, but not personal. I’m used to be adressed by my name when I fly business class.  While serving the meals, they forget serving me wine. The amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin. After dinner I went to sleep. The seat is turned into a real bed, with an extra mattress and a good pillow. The space is narrow, it is difficult to make the bed. Once the bed is made, there is no place to put  personal stuff. I had a real good night of sleep though. If your seat is not at the aisle, you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet. The toilets are small and simple, not cleaned frequently enough. When I woke up, breakfast service was running.  The breakfast is good.  Yoghurt, pastries, fresh fruit, and a full English Breakfast. Overall, British Airways World Club is a rather standard Business Class, lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience.  If BA wants to compete, they have a long way to go.

inflight service was distinctly average,31 reviews,26/11/2019,United Kingdom,"  London to Johannesburg with British Airways. BA’s B gates lounge is a rather more civilised place to pass time than the Galleries Lounges in the main terminal. It’s also a tad closer on the transit - or via the rather useful walkway on level -4 - to the C gates where the A380s depart from. The new boarding by groups meant snaking queues, but at least group 2 moved fairly speedily. The Club World were still the same, much maligned seats with the small, unresponsive IFE screens and limited selection of films. The dinner service was slow because of the unwise introduction of individual trays brought to each seat. Trolleys may lack glamour, but one does get off to sleep quicker on an overnight flight. Breakfast was adequate but nothing more. Landing was exactly on time.

a remarkably bad experience,J Cohlen,16/11/2019,Ireland,"  London to Vancouver. I used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively. I flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience. Food service was very poor in most aspects. I had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes. No drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing. Rather, tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed. I had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.This then put me out of sync with the service. The one time (yes one time!) offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely. Service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality. On a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! Our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else. The cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing. The entertainment system is a joke as it is so old. I had become so accustomed to a normal/newish TV screen that I was blown away that this system was still in place. The screen size was the equivalent of your phone’s. No music selection worth talking about so I just used my iPad. On this or similar routes I have flown Air Canada, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, Air Transat. BA was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only. I cannot believe that the mighty BA offers such a terrible product in 2019.

We missed our connecting flight. The staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didn’t know what to do. We ended up being shunted onto another flight resulting in a four hour delay. All of this inconvenience is due to BA’s incompetent management.

a very friendly and welcoming crew,C Irving,12/11/2019,United Kingdom," Tirana to London Gatwick. I fly British Airways around six times a month thanks to my work, and while I almost always have a pleasant experience, this past flight definitely outdid all the others. We boarded and departed exactly on time, with a very friendly and welcoming crew. While the flight was fully booked, my travel companion and I were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat, and therefore more space. The best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of Wi-Fi which I have never had on any other British Airways flight within Europe. In fact, the Wi-Fi package I got which included only texting, was unlimited and incredibly fast - as good as my home connection! This truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me. Something that British Airways can improve on would be leg space, which in this flight I noticed was particularly tight, although that is a common problem for me as I am 1.88 cm tall. Also, for unknown reasons, no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight, only drinks. This was a slight struggle as I had skipped breakfast, but I managed well.

don’t trust BA with your loved ones,O Robins,02/11/2019,United Kingdom," London to Belfast. British Airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion. I booked my parents on BA to attend my investiture at the Palace. My mother had a heart attack 3 months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and I had chosen BA expecting the best level of service. Instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff. My mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and I booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side. I printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d. On arrival at check-in, one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one. On going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed. Once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed. My father explained the situation but the rep at check-in started quoting the ‘Geneva convention’ that BA are only contracted to get them from A to B and could change seats if they wanted. Waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances. At no stage did they receive any apologetic words. For someone recovering from a heart attack, this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion. I have been holding on with the hope that BAs slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed. I will await BAs response to my parents; I know they will not fly the carrier again but I will be handing back my BA Amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued. Will update!

I repeated many times the word ale with my Spanish accent, but she still did not catch it. The male attendant said “like an IPA”, I answered “yes”.  I changed to a beer and she offered me Amstel or Heineken, I chose Amstel and had to ask for ice  to make it drinkable. When the service was finished the female attendant collected the empty bottles and cans and glasses but skipped me. For the meal I chose the beef and asked for a beer. The male attendant realized that the empty can was still there, took it. With the food on my and no drinks I started to eat, after ten minutes it was obvious that the beer was not coming, so I stopped another attendant going to Business class and he came back with an option of Tiger or Heineken lager. The female attendant offered me coffee but she did not mention it was normal coffee and in the menu it said that decaf was available if you specifically request that.

glorified budget airline,H Smith,16/10/2019,United Kingdom, London to Athens. British Airways is a glorified budget airline. A 3.5-hour flight and back to Athens and no food or drinks provided. Ask for a cup of water and they charge you a ridiculous price. An M&S inflated price sandwich is the 'meal'. No entertainment options either. No USB charging on the seat as well.

easily the most cramped space I have ever flown,Mark Donadio,16/10/2019,United States,"  Terrible lack of any leg and body room in economy. This was easily the most cramped space I have ever flown. And I travel a lot. The flight was 7 hours of leg cramps and pain with no room for any modicum of comfort. The little amount of space in economy cabin is disgusting. If the seat in front of you reclines, as they invariably do, there is even less room. Shameful. The food was below average as well, even for bottom of the barrel budget airplane food. I will never fly British Airways again. 0 stars. Beware.

On the same multi segment trip I tried SQ business class and EK business class (and sadly the old BA business class on an aging B777) on overnight trips. The new ""business suite"" offering from BA is the best business class I have experienced. I am a BA Gold card holder and the experience was outstanding. The First lounge at DXB was very good with plenty of seating and a good choice of drinks. Food choice in the lounge was limited but not an issue. On board the new suite was very comfortable and I had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in. The bed was very comfortable. Food choices were very limited (soup and sandwiches) although this did suit the timing of the flight. I would say this is an excellent very serious business product for night time business travellers.

Only one check in open for all passengers, no bag drop facilities, no facility to print boarding passes. When invited to board we had to wait 20 minutes on the ramp before being let on the plane.

"staff wonderful. cheerful, efficient",Rosemary Prescott,28/09/2019,United Kingdom," We have had some torrid experiences with BA - which we have not been shy to report. So when we flew yesterday with them from Heathrow to Austin and had a great flight in every way, it felt right to feedback on that. The staff in the upstairs business class cabin were, frankly, wonderful. Cheerful, efficient and calm. What more could you ask? The food was pretty nice and the champagne lovely. The beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy. I literally cannot think of any real negatives. The luggage lockers were quite small but then it’s an older model of the plane so that probably explains it. If only BA could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion, they would once again be the “world’s favourite airline’. Sadly, the current CEO doesn’t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful. Perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better. Although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time. As we entered the (literally empty) immigration area, we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine, who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars! Surreal, as anyone who regularly travels to the States, will testify! It felt as if we were living in the Truman Show at one point but in the nicest possible way.

"not too bad, all in all",31 reviews,26/09/2019,United Kingdom," The start of our journey back from from EFL was inauspicious, with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge, awaiting flights on airlines other than BA. As it was, weather in the UK plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by 90 minutes. Once airborne in a refitted A320 (complete with a nice fresh leather smell!), cabin crew in CE were friendly and efficient, and the food (including a cod dish) was quite reasonable. It was interesting to note that the refit hadn't extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear. A big plus on the flight - and a first for me - was WiFi, which actually worked and was quite fast - although at a cost of £4.99 for an hour's use. I thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers, but evidently not. Landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights. However, BA had laid on a separate bus for CE passengers and we were out of the airport 30 minutes later.

the value was very good,M Irving,21/09/2019,United Kingdom," Having booked this flight a week before the BA strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before I flew and not in fact the day before, I was apprehensive as to how it would operate. The check-in and security clearance at T5 took only 15 minutes. Personally I do not like the self service bag and tag drop that BA operate as one is not 100% confident that I did everything correctly. Boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to 5) which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. Again I'm not a fan of this. Possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights, the aircraft was a large A321. Boarding was however smooth. On board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the EuroTraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (I'm 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front). The departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. In flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin (believe 2 in Club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. Again it is a shame though that BA have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline. The landing at Tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking. Tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not BA's fault.",A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Berlin Tegel,01/09/2019,yes,Verified,3,5,5,3,3,5,-1

the food was horrendous,20 reviews,04/09/2019,Australia,"  Sydney to London via Singapore with British Airways. I made the mistake of ordering vegetarian meals on this flight - the food was horrendous, I was served an indistinguishable uniform mass of what appeared to be mashed, overcooked potatoes (and maybe other vegetables, I am not sure) for one meal and an ice cold frittata/sandwich which should clearly have been heated up. The latter I took one bite and couldn't continue. I have had better meals in economy class in other airlines. The seat was nothing to write home about, but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class (with the price difference to match of course). The service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is available. On the plus side, I am glad there are shared toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin, instead of having to walk all the way to the back of the plane like some other flights.

But in addition, if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight, you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. With that said in 2018, my wife and I made reservations on BA to fly to Johannesburg from London for an African adventure this October, specifically 10/31. Yes, that's the day called for Brexit. Only we made our reservations before those dates were set. Considering BA pilots have called for three pilot strikes on September 2019, coupled with Brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. The good news is close to $800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines Advantage. The bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded. I called BA to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. I was just not feeling the love here! So I am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly British Airways. All of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance. Instead of BA, we changed our booking to 10/30 on Etihad Airways through Abu Dhabi. Their customer service was outstanding. The fees were lower and yes, no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and I can travel next to each other. I am entering travel in September 2019, because there was no other option for future travel. This request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight. This is an airline policy review and lets the buyer beware.",A380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Johannesburg,01/09/2019,no,Not Verified,4,1,1,-1,1,1,-1

customer service is increasingly low cost in feel,A Norton,22/08/2019,United Kingdom, London Gatwick to San Jose Costa Rica. This was a very similar experience outbound and inbound. I am sure the plane was the same. I am a gold card holder and until this moment have always chosen BA. I am seriously considering not doing this again. The 777-200 we flew in business was dirty and old. I flew my family of 5 business class but 2 of the 5 seats did not operate - no headphones socket jack that operated. The screens were from the ark. Crew as always excellent but BA should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experience. I was told by the crew that they would contact me to tell me what would be outcome of the issue. I have heard to date zip. At least it was better than last year flying into DC from London when the seat did not recline even with a manual adjuster. That time at least we received AVIOS.

Crew on board very friendly and helpful but at times struggled to provide full dinner service speedily. Food was excellent. Business Class cabin comfortable. Weather related delay and blocked arrival gate resulted in short connection time at LHR.

Our route was a little different, instead of going over France, Switzerland, etc, we went over Germany, Hungary, etc. The food was good and wasn't too expensive.

On boarding, 2 cabin staff by entrance stood chatting amongst themselves and totally ignored customers - not a great start. Usual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of money. The breakfast standards (full English) are about the same as a charter flight standard, and despite what BA shout about, this has gone through some considerable cost cutting.

flight has improved my opinion on British Airways,45 reviews,29/07/2019,Thailand," Johannesburg to Cape Town return. This flight was operated by Comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal British Airways flight in Europe. Check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that Oneworld Sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if I was flying business. Johannesburg airport and Cape Town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. Their lounge, called SLOW is actually impressive. Although there was no full english on offer unlike the British Airways Galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. They even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. I assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. Very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. Priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. I would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. I reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking. These seats were old and plush, however I do prefer the newer leather seat used on their European aircraft as those offer better support. I had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. I did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. There were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. Needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. It was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. The crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. They were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. In Cape Town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. But since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. I think that this flight has improved my opinion on British Airways, and they were the same price as the competition, South African Airways. I would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on Africa's busiest air route. For the price paid, I'd be happy to fly them again.",Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg OR Tambo to Cape Town,01/07/2019,yes,Verified,5,4,5,5,5,5,5
seat comfort has been sacrificed,David Worten,28/07/2019,United Kingdom,"  Grenada to Gatwick. Having flown with BA on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment, I was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin. The cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant. The entertainment system was hugely improved, with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices. I suppose the reason I appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated! But the family really found them entertaining. For me the real issue was the tight leg room - I am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal! It was for me very tight. Previously the seat format was 3-3-3. It is now 3-4-3. We were sat in the 4 outbound although on return, we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2-4-2. We sat in a 2, which was more bearable. I also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit! Despite best efforts to sleep, I failed..... I remember the old seats being more comfortable, especially for long haul. Service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights - edible.

Going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace! The food (I use this term lightly) wasn’t fit for dogs on our flight, it was salmon we think as it didn’t taste of anything, a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let alone eat it. The veg tasted burnt, bread roll was ok. (Not really a saving grace). One cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and don’t bother asking what was in the box left on our table! I didn’t bother trying it. The look on other people’s faces was good enough for me to know don’t bother! Which in comparison to the outbound flight (London to Orlando) was worlds apart, greeted with a drink which was the first of many, dinner was nice, the steak edible, veg cooked just right and dessert was nice with plenty of drinks! Inflight entertainment was good even though there was supposed to be WiFi but couldn’t log on so saved some money there. I really thought this was going to be the best way to travel. Oh a broken seat for one of our party was a bit disappointing, homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was an older plane.

During this service no further drinks were offered except for water, trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for 4 hours. They reappeared about 70 minutes before landing served a box containing stale bread with processed cheese and a stale cake, I politely refused the offering and my partner ate the bread, tea and coffee was served.

On this trip like the previous the plane broke down, and we waited 2.5 hours on the plane for it to be repaired whilst the temperature outside was 42 degrees. The cabin crew director offered passengers the opportunity to purchase water and other cold drinks from the bar. Only BA could try to make money out of one of its technical failures.

a positive experience,R Sanyal,29/06/2019,United States," New York to Glasgow via London. A routine and smooth overnight flight that departed the gate about 45 minutes late because of a security issue at the terminal (#7). I had an electronic boarding pass on the BA app but an announcement was made that we needed to get paper versions. There was a separate desk where a couple of agents performed this task. The pilot introduced the flight attendants as “gorgeous” - which came across to me as inappropriate. I would have preferred efficient or even helpful to describe them. I had an aisle seat in a 3-3-3 seat layout. The middle seat was unoccupied. Enough leg space and storage space overhead. A good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphones provided. The IFE system was easy to use. A drink service preceded the meal service. I asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed IPA Brewdog Speedbird 100. Sensing that I might not enjoy it, the attendant also gave me a Heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter. The entree choices were chicken and pasta. I chose the later. Very basic food. Tea and coffee followed. Before landing a sandwich and a drink was served. I could not figure out what was in the sandwich! The bathroom was clean. Blankets and pillows were on every seat. Alighting was quick. Landing cards have been done away with. For the fare, I paid I was satisfied - no complaints. I connected to a domestic flight to Glasgow. The announcement of the gate was made quite late. Newspapers were available at the gate - a worthy amenity. It was a smooth flight in a 3-3 seating. I was in an aisle seat, the next to me was empty. No complimentary food or drink on this segment. The two flight attendants, once the plane reached cruising altitude, put on aprons and pushed a cart down the aisle hawking edibles and elixirs. The pilot introduced them as gorgeous. Both on this and the earlier flight, a video presentation showed off the safety instructions. It was supposed to be funny and engaging. I felt it was neither - the accents of the actors were hard to understand. The flight landed on time. Overall, a positive experience but next time I will look into a non-stop flight to Glasgow from New York.

Outbound flight was fine,Tony McLaughlin,26/06/2019,United Kingdom,"  BA 2616 and 2617 return trip from Gatwick to Cagliari. Both flights on a Saturday and were full. Aircraft was an A320-200 on both legs. Sat in row 7 outbound, 2 rows behind Club Europe. Sat in row 25 on the return, leg room seemed tighter than row 7. The brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been in the BMI Fleet. Didn’t bother with the new M&S On Board service outward, but did on the return. The M&S sandwich was everything you would expect from an M&S sandwich (apart from the cost), but the coffee I had and the tea my wife had were below standard. It also took the 2 cabin crew the best part of 75 minutes to get from row 6 to row 25. The other 2 members of the cabin crew appeared to hide in Club Europe attending to just 10 passengers. Despite quite a lot of turbulence and the Seat Belt sign on for about 30 minutes, they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful. You are now given a cup of hot water to add your coffee or tea bag to. Also a queue of 7 or 8 passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley, and they would not return to their seats. The rubbish from the trolley service was collected by hand as we were preparing to land. Outbound flight was fine, Inbound flight was not a great advertisement for BA.

Also left Kalamata about 1/2 hour late on our return but landed virtually on time. Seats much more comfortable with more padding than, for example, Ryanair or Jet2.com so with the extra legroom, the flights were pretty comfortable.

return flight was very cold,4 reviews,20/06/2019,United Kingdom,"  I had some difficulty from the start, after my initial booking the website repeatedly asked me to log in, even though I was already logged in. I wanted to reserve seats and request special meals. It took me 2 days to achive this. I was amazed by the cost of reserving ordinary seats, no extra legroom, this bumped the price up for 4 people by £328 and seats were only booked on the LHR-KUL and return KUL-LHR legs. I had difficulty checking in using the BA app and eventually did it using Malaysia Airlines app. Checking in online was only allowed 24hrs before making things a little awkward being in Kuching for our return leg with an 8 hr time difference. I was looking forward to flying on the Boeing 787 but it really is just a dream. Food choices we were told ran out at breakfast, the choice was full English or just an omelette, but the full English ran out or so we were told, but looking over my shoulder a few minutes later and another trolley had appeared with the full English on it. Earlier meals were ok with beer, wine and other drinks available. There was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and we had to go to the rear galley to ask for water. For an over 12h flight, I think the cabin should at least be visited 2-3 times. Toilets were clean and worked ok and the aircraft as a whole was clean and tidy. The IFE selection was superb with many of the latest films available along with games and music.

I  called them two and a half weeks prior to departure to check that the meals were in the system, and was assured they were.

I might fly them again,2 reviews,07/06/2019,United States,"  Belfast City to Atlanta via London Heathrow T5. Check-in was fairly smooth at Belfast as it was early in the morning. However, when the agent called me over the check me in, he was all flustered that I wasn't an elite Executive Club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty. I knew he was working the premium line, but nobody was standing in it, and I was standing in the regular line when he called me. After about 20 minutes, I finally got a boarding pass to go through security. The flight from BHD to LHR was uneventful and bare-bones, as nothing was served for free on the flight. My boyfriend therefore hated it, as we're used to getting better service on American in the US, but I was fully aware that BA had turned itself into a glorified EasyJet. Once we arrived to LHR, I continued by myself to Atlanta on BA and was shocked at the crowded, user-unfriendly T5. Although I suppose it was pretty in some ways, I had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called, so it felt very crowded and hot. After my flight was called, I found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people. Boarding was straightforward, however, and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers, even in economy. The flight product was just OK in my view. I had an exit row aisle seat, and while I had extra room and a nice headrest, the seat was right by the lav, so it stank. IFE was fine with a decent selection, but it was not as complete as Delta's. The food was the bland equivalent of what Delta serves, so no brownie points there, and the ""tea"" service they had was terrible: we were given half-sandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages. I remember years ago when BA was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile. Those smiles have disappeared for the most part, and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there. However, I arrived on time and promptly got my bag. The 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite, so I might fly them again, though I would not recommend BA due to the crowds and discomfort I experienced at T5.",A319 / Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Belfast  to Atlanta via London,01/04/2019,no,Verified,9,3,4,2,3,2,3
my luggage arrived soaking wet,12 reviews,06/06/2019,United Kingdom,"  London to Nashville. The worst airline Trans-Atlantic. Despite looking forward to flying on this new route to Nashville, British Airways ruined this trip. The flight was delayed by over three hours, whilst they ostensibly replaced the damaged aircraft with an inbound Boeing 787-9 from San Jose. The airplane was filthy dirty in Club Class, which is bad enough having to suffer the awful, dated, Club Class ying-yang facing, narrow seats with divider. Business Class on British Airways is the worst of any airline. The WIFI was out of service. On late arrival in Nashville, my luggage arrived soaking wet, and I was unable to change clothes. On my return to the UK, I contacted British Airways Customer Relations to seek compensation, and got the usual pathetic, mainly computer generated, insincere apology. I am now forced to haggle with British Airways, and endure their woeful so-called Customer Relations department. It is a real shame to witness the decline of this national carrier.

couple of very good flights,Mark Simons,28/05/2019,United Kingdom,  London to Milan. Evening outbound flight with some on board space so middle seat was empty. Boarding by group number worked effectively and I was able to store my laptop in the overhead. Free newspapers were available in the jet way. Passengers were warmly greeted. I was one row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her bag stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently. Usual on board trolley service which I didn't use. Flight departed 10 minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in Linate 20 minutes late. Return flight could have been a challenge due to Italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed 15 minutes early. The cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer - outstanding. We were taken off the aircraft and bussed into T5 which I think actually saved time as the entrance is directly below passport control.

service on this flight was superb,Ken Howie,28/05/2019,South Africa,"  The connecting flight to Johannesburg was on an older 737-400 with proper business class seats and lots of legroom. Pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight. Everything went smoothly and service was good. Boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly, we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin. Much has been said about the BA ying-yang seat configuration. The seats are narrow, and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat, with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat. However the seat is very comfortable in any position, and the White Company bedding is excellent. We had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin, which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down. The centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings, and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger. The service on this flight was superb, from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient, quick to respond, and super friendly. Preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated, with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off. There was a choice of 4 starters, 3 mains, and 3 sweets or cheeseboard, with a decent choice of wines. Breakfast offered a good choice, although we were happy with just the fruit, yoghurt, and bread. There could be no complaints in respect of catering. The A380 is a super aircraft and very quiet, but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew. Our connecting flight to Leeds was good, but compared with our South African flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat. It is a short flight, but there was still a full meal service. The only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in Leeds. The airport seems quite run-down, escalator not working, and few staff to be seen.

an old style business class experience,31 reviews,27/05/2019,United Kingdom," CPT is definitely getting its act together: BA's Galleries Lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once. The upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in Club World. That's despite the ancient yin/yang seats and the tiny IFE screen with appalling resolution. The new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious. The dinner service was according to the new CW 'soft' design, which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually. On the whole, I think it works and having the 'triple bread' roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it, rather than served with the dessert. Breakfast has been streamlined, too, and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff. Apart from some inevitable turbulence, the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule.

There was a bad delay on the Belfast flight.  We were not allowed to re-enter the lounge when the plane developed a fault, as we had gone through security.  Only after 40 minutes were we allowed to re-enter the lounge. Service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what BA was sending us via texts.

return flight extremely poor,Ian Robinson,22/05/2019,United Kingdom,"  
Gatwick to Barbados return. I normally travel on BA with low expectations with the result that I am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised. The outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an OK cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful. However, the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in Barbados before the Virgin flight that was scheduled to leave Gatwick five minutes before us, with the result that we got through arrivals quickly. The return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of BA with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years. Once again when you travel west to east, the crew (specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin) somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal. The pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the PE cabin (not a big deal but irritating non the less). No bread was served with dinner, despite there being butter on the plate, so I presume it was missed. My wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else, which was fine. However, as the crew were serving the remaining meals, there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys. When they reached our row, they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap, although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid. It also spilled on my Kindle which thankfully had the cover closed. A very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and I suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made. My wife's wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner. Once again we landed on time, which was a good thing.

Overall a decent flight,8 reviews,19/05/2019,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Malaga. Check in was fairly quick. The check in area at Gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep. The whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets. If you’re not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring. The lounge at Gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy, there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit. The food and drink offering was very good. Tasty and varied. On board I was lucky to be able to book the exit row, which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion. Food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasn’t a problem for me. The food offering is fairly poor really, a couple of sandwiches or snacks.. drinks selection is better. What was very nice was, near the end of the flight I was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member. I wouldn’t expect this, and I’m sure it’s just because they had a bottle to use up, but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers. Still no WiFi or WiFi based in flight entertainment offered. Priority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevant. My bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bags.

Was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the Window. Seat itself was the standard one, comfortable. The boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft. There was never a massive crowd in front of the gate. The inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal. The food was very mediocre at best - not worth losing sleep over it. There was serious bumps along the way midflight. The A380 being so massive easily absorbed it. Return was on a B777 - flight was not full but almost full. The inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey. The baggage drop area however was a disaster. None of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers. The boarding was again very orderly. Both outbound and inbound IFE was good but not as good as some long haul carriers.

a pretty good flight,31 reviews,18/05/2019,United Kingdom,"  London to Cape Town in First and our first taste of the new 'soft' product. Still, unfortunately, a 30 year-old 747 that hadn't had its refurbishment and was showing its age. A wardrobe door that's falling off its hinges, a non-touch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that won't stay shut don't pass muster in First and blemish the impression of the positive changes in the on-board service. The young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained about. Care was also taken in preparing and plating up the food. For once, nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decent. Bedding is also improved, with a good quality duvet and large pillow. The IFE remains the same low-res screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film. The goodies bag is much better and worth taking home. Overall, a pretty good flight, but it remains to be seen what BA will do with its long-in-the-tooth First Class when their new Club Suites are launched.",Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,First Class,London to Cape Town,01/05/2019,yes,Verified,2,4,4,4,3,3,3

nothing too much trouble,Philip Gregory,07/05/2019,United Kingdom," Washington to London. Having travelled out to Washington from Heathrow on 23/04/19 First Class I wasn't overly impressed. Although the Concorde Room was relaxing and comfortable, the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive. The cabin crew were polite but quite surgical in their manner which gave an overall impression of a cold and clinical approach. My return journey couldn't have been more different. The BA lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi-light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew. Nothing short of amazing. I was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about. Demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach. A fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist. Having had mixed levels of service with BA and always flying Virgin I think BA need to track down this staff member and use her as the model for all future cabin crew training.",Boeing 747 400,Business,First Class,Washington to London,01/05/2019,yes,Verified,2,4,4,4,3,4,4

disappointing business class,P Merton,04/05/2019,United Kingdom,"  London to Shanghai. The most disappointing business class I have flown in a long time. The plane was old, worn and dirty (there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight), It took 2 hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off - the food followed shortly, which was over cooked. They seemed to be short on staff. However, what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before I’d even been offered a drink. The service was exceptionally poor. I am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight. As a Gold card holder, you might have thought BA would check their frequent fliers are being looked after? I’ll return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips, such as Cathay, JAL or Finnair. The only reason that I’ve given more than one star is that I managed to sleep quite well - the bedding and pillows were good.

a very good overall service,Christopher Rainbow,22/04/2019,United Kingdom,  Dublin to London Heathrow. British Airways offered a very good overall service on this flight. I booked online and found that process very easy. The caveat was not being able to select the seat I wanted ahead of travel without paying another fee. The check-in lady was very friendly and helpful and gave a good account of herself. The flight departed on-time and the captain made frequent announcements. Within the previous two weeks I had flown with BA twice within Europe and this flight was by the best of the 3 thanks to the staff. The flight was relatively short but well managed with a nice drop down map and staff visibly make a real effort.

the product is outdated,V Marasevic,18/04/2019,United States,"  London to Seattle. My seat was on the upper deck, a nice perk for Seattle flights to Europe (BA is the only one flying 747s to Europe from Seattle). Overall the product is outdated. Service was not at the level it used to be. Staff is polite and professional but they keep the service to a minimum.  Upper deck crew on this flight was mainly uninterested except the bare minimum.  No additional service, no top ups, not offering water during the flight. Of course if you ask for something you do get it. There was also a lot of traffic on the stairway connecting upper and lower deck with the crew congregating at the lower deck.  I hope BA will improve their act.

Lunch and a pre landing snack were provide together with an ice cream mid flight. Commendably, even in these days of austerity, my pre lunch gin was served with Fever Tree tonic. Well done BA. Frequent drinks runs were made. Despite its age the Jumbo was well turned out internally. The only downside was because of Air Traffic issues at Heathrow the flight arrived late. This meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic flight.

both involuntarily downgraded,H Warner,11/04/2019,United Kingdom,"  St Lucia to Gatwick on which my wife and I were both involuntarily downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy due overbooking on the flight. It should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at Vieux Fort Airport. I now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades. At the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate. Once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and I were being downgraded to economy. The male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under Article 7.3 of EC 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights. He then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again. The male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us, we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and I on a row with no other passengers which we assumed, rightly or wrongly, was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from BA. However two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem. What further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching Gatwick and after the Pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions, never telling the passenger to raise their seat. BA’s latest advert celebrates 100 years of BA but for me their service is going backwards. The music that accompanies the advert is called ‘Salvation’ and by the end of the flight my wife and I were surely seeking it.

M&S food available to passengers ran out while cabin crew were half way down the aisle. Larnaca to Heathrow - two messages received while in Larnaca airport - the flight would be delayed by over an hour-departure was supposed to be at 7.15 pm but we took off nearer to 9 pm. The second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight, ""we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us"". The flight was 5 hours long-so this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable - worse than a budget airline. A midnight arrival at Heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a ""balance problem"". In addition I was incorrectly charged Eur 75 on the return leg for my case - it was clearly the same case that I travlled out to Cyprus with but the system identified it as extra baggage. Cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers. The only saving grace was the cabin crew-particularly the Customer Service Manager-who promised to follow up the baggage issue and logged my complaint. It will take ages to resolve but he was helpful and pleasant throughout.

BA have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight . If you are travelling solo a retractable divider gives you privacy from your neighbour. Only problem is the 2x3x2 layout is one too many seats across, as it leaves two very narrow gangways; if you have an aisle seat in the ""turn right"" section in Business Class you will be constantly whacked unintentionally(?) by Economy section passengers with their carry-ons when boarding. Food and drinks were excellent, with courses served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to their passengers. Entertainment choice also excellent with a film choice for everyone.

effectively a low cost airline,S Beale,09/03/2019,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to St Lucia return. Recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in Caribbean for a 60th birthday celebration. Tickets bought in August 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a Club Class return, having flown out Premium Economy. Arrived at airport to be told that we'd been downgraded to Premium Economy due to overbooking. Apologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the plane. Fuming all the way back to London, exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea when I asked for coffee) and filthy food. Complained on return through BA exec Club webiste with response from Customer Service 10 days later. BA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology. Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. BA has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years. BA is now effectively a low cost airline, flying a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline. The accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet. Avoid this airline if you possible can. And the final insult in booking premium seats with BA is that you get charge £40 to pre reserve in Club and £70 in Premium Economy. BA, you are having a laugh with the flying public.

BA staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but that's all changed. From the time of arriving at London Heathrow T5 the staff have been really friendly and helpful. Similarly on the flight, the attendants couldn't do enough for me. When I requested tomato juice with Worcester sauce, the attendant made a special trip to the rear to get it. On the way back I asked for a tonic water and, again, they offered to go and get it. The seating of these newer planes allows me knee room, even though I'm 6ft 3ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough too. The entertainment system, though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of Cathay Pacific, nevertheless had a good range of movies and TV to watch. Both flights ended up arriving on time, despite delays at Heathrow both ways, and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on. Food quality was reasonable, again not up to the standard of Cathay Pacific, rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which I thought was a bit mean.

The most miserable rip off,Clive Drake,07/03/2019,United Kingdom," 
London Heathrow / Pisa return. My wife and I fly this route 3-4 times a year as we have a home in Tuscany. Sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price, or we pay using Avios. This return trip was the latter. It is what it is. The most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world. I have seen last minute flights on this route as high as £700 return. BA should be ashamed of themselves. The only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions. The seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit. The new meals are quite good and the free (is it really free?) booze. The seats are the biggest con. Three seats for two - with a dumb table in the middle. Unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster. On the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad + wine. On the way back - a ploughman's lunch, it was okay-ish. As a 60 year old businessman, one who has worked globally in my career in the US, Japan and the Middle East - and having sold my business a few years ago, to one of the largest PLCs in the country - I think I know a bit about running companies. I know I could do a lot better than the current board at BA. Last week when I was away, I read that BA have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year. Oh, what a surprise and that's the clear objective of the directors. So what would I do with Club Europe? I'd make it the best in Europe. The seat would be larger, like an arm chair. A 2+2 configuration. There would be a nice centre table. Charge ports for phones/laptops. Headsets. TV screens mainly for news - but some movies for flights over 2 hours. Extra 6"" of leg room behind row ""1"". Nice cutlery and glass/china ware. Hot meals. And i'd probably sell it at £25 a flight more. ""Build value guys"" and the profits will follow. Its the oldest dictum in the book. I will give credit where credit is due. On the way back, on the ground, the Captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron. As an aviation buff I loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal. Clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane. He picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk, the length of plane, asking if anyone had concerns or questions. One or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure. Very nice chap. We took off 2 hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine. FAs in both directions were very good.",A320,Family Leisure,Business Class,London to Pisa,01/03/2019,no,Verified,3,1,4,2,3,1,-1
planes are ancient,R Davis,04/03/2019,United States, Edinburgh to Boston via London. The planes are ancient and need to be replaced. If these were cars they would have an antique plate. The seats are uncomfortable and worn. There is no lumbar support. The space between the seatback in front and your face is inches. It’s really claustrophobic. The food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choice. So for $1200 each we had horrible seats and terrible food. The short connecting flights do not even offer bottled water. The M&S menu is expensive and offers limited choices. Meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the price. The planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy. The cabin crew on the BOS to LHR and LHR to EDI were good. There was one member in the LHR to BOS who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her job. Boarding is supposed to be by group but was a disaster as people queued up well before their section was called and it made it extremely difficult to get to board.

British Airways are a disgrace,E Mouton,03/03/2019,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Mauritius. My wife and 2 friends booked and paid £56 each to select our seats with additional legroom adjacent to the bassinet stowage. On boarding the flight the configuration of the aircraft differed, meaning we had the same seat row and number but without the additional legroom. My formal complaint to BA has been met with what can only be described as condescending platitudes and a blank refusal to refund our seat booking fee. We feel that this a scam and are continuing to pursue the matter. Trading standards are also being informed. It didn’t help the aircraft was delayed by 4 hours on the outward leg, was filthy dirty. The return flight had numerous IFE defects and my seat recline did not work. I also noted a number of cabin minor airworthiness issues, (I am a licensed engineer). A marketing email in celebration of 100 years of service has thanked me for flying hundreds of thousands of miles with BA and then rips me off with nothing in return.

out of date airplanes,12 reviews,26/02/2019,United Kingdom,"  Chicago to London Heathrow. Club Class on British Airways is without doubt the worst in the airline industry.  It is bad enough that BA persist using out of date airplanes, circa 25 year old B747-400's, but they perpetuate the dreadful ying/yang seating arrangement of Club Class, where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you, and raise a screen for privacy. Then, mid-flight the crew lower the screen to serve the food. To leave the seat, one has to climb over the legs of a sleeping passenger;~no mean feat in the dark. The crew from Chicago were appalling, and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible. Breakfast was inedible, and I returned it uneaten. The lounge at O'Hare was a crowded, tiny, dirty facility, with a food bar including some wilted vegetables and crackers with cheese. Insufficient chairs, and a single, old TV.

twenty years out of date,12 reviews,26/02/2019,United Kingdom,"  London to Chicago. Could it get any worse? The flight to Chicago was equipped with the usual ancient Boeing 747-400. The British Airways First Class product doesn't come up to modern Business Class standards. This particular flight was late again, and the food / wine was simply awful. There is nothing remotely elegant about BA First Class, and the crew demonstrate no sophistication. This experience was like dining at your worst restaurant chain. Finally, not only is the aircraft tired and worn out, but the in flight so-called entertainment system did not work, and had to be rebooted twice. The First Class seat is a bad joke, and extraordinarily uncomfortable. British Airways are at least twenty years out of date with their entire First Class product. All that can be said about this airline is woeful.

We left on time, and that was the only positive point. I started watching a movie, and a young flight attendant  approached and asked for my dinner choice. I told her that I would love a G&T to start with, and then I will read the menu. She told me that this was a late evening departure (9pm is not late for me) and that no pre-dinner drinks would be served. I insisted (this is business class after all, half full flight). 30 minutes later, she brought a tray with everything on it (G&T, first dish, main dish, and dessert).  Never was I offered wine or coffee. The lights were turned off, and I did not see a flight attendant until 1:30 hours before landing.

Flight on time, not completely full, had an aisle seat near back of plane without the entertainment box in the way. Some reviews say that the last few windows are blanked off at rear of the aircraft but not so on this plane. Breakfast was served which was OK. Cabin crew mixed, mostly young and worked quickly. Crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the world. There is good and bad still with BA - bad was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival - leathery and inedible - why do they let themselves down with such a poor offering - hardly any passengers near me could eat it. Bad was that there was an old tissue and food wrapper in my seat pocket. Good was the newer aircraft and the breakfast has improved.

worth the price,S Willetts,20/02/2019,South Korea,"  London to Seoul. I normally fly business but this was a last minute flight and the cost of Club was prohibitive and so I thought I would give World Traveller Plus a go. The cabin is stylish and intimate and I was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were. The entertainment system was working well (although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying). I was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming. My only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available. A similar thing happened with breakfast, three options, the third being the most appetizing, and no, it hadn't been loaded, so this is an area BA might want to look into. All in all the service was good and worth the price.

would be my last choice,G Beele,15/02/2019,Spain,"  My husband and I flew on British Airways flight BA-228 from Baltimore to London Heathrow leaving on the 12th February 2019. Every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer. The plane was shabby and dated. The seat reclining facility did not operate properly, was not that comfortable, and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines. The touch screen TV monitor was not working properly. One ear bud on the headphones did not work. The audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in-flight entertainment (which in itself had a dated choice). The pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover. The air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air. The restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied. However what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew. They were abrupt, unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there. There was one exception, an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight. There did not appear to be any organisation or smooth co-ordination when distributing the meals. Our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member. This flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight. There was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed. Unlike all the other airlines that I have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them. British Airways would be my last choice of an airline to travel with and I would only fly with them again if there was no other option.",Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to London Heathrow,01/02/2019,no,Verified,5,1,1,1,2,2,1

both felt a bit disappointed,8 reviews,11/02/2019,United Kingdom,"  Tokyo to London. I was looking forward to this flight because of the Club World ticket and because it was my first time flying on a Boeing 787. We had a good check-in experience, breezed through the airport and enjoyed the JAL Lounge at Narita. We boarded on time and first impressions of the Boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded. The food and wines were really good. I had a beautifully-presented Japanese starter followed by a bento-style lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options. There was plenty of choice on the IFE and there was a big screen. On the downside, the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight. This was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too. The seat was comfortable and reclined fully but I find the layout of BA Club World a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger's footrest to access the aisle. The cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming. The context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to Tokyo. We had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew. We both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement, but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight.",Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Tokyo Narita to London Heathrow,01/01/2019,yes,Verified,1,4,3,5,5,4,5

We had very grand seats with lovely surroundings. The cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted. The food and alcoholic drinks were great. I went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding. I was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the IFE. My wife and I both said afterwards that it didn't feel like a long-haul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably.

After take off the crew dispensed with pre dinner drinks and went straight for meal. Portions of starter very small, I was given someone else’s by mistake which was then taken away and given to him. I thought that originally the idea of the new Club World meal involved a trolley service but no sign of that. Main was good (beef), dessert was cheese, very small basic selection.

reasonable flight,31 reviews,30/01/2019,United Kingdom," A380 boarding is always a nightmare, but it was complicated on this occasion by multiple pax in wheelchairs and a delayed show-up by the pilots. Fortunately, we still managed to take off more or less on time. The cabin crew responsible for our side of the First cabin was personable but lacked experience. The food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre. Warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience. The seats in First are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors' premium cabin. The duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin. One of the First toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the Club World loos upstairs. It would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience, but no comment was made. The IFE was passable and the sound quality good if one's own noise cancelling headphones are used. WiFi was available but I didn't make use of it. Breakfast was unremarkable and I wish bread rather than pastries was offered. Deplaning was delayed by half-an-hour because of early morning congestion at T5 and the lack of a stand.

A full cabin also means queues for the two loos, although they're a lot more spacious than in First. The drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours, but the revamped Club World food is definitely an improvement. The fish option for the main course was some of the best food I've had in the air. The White Company bedding does little to cushion the rather hard seats.

We checked in as soon as the online check in was available to find that only 4 seats (for the 4 of us) remained unbooked. We had to take 2 seats on the front row where the seats had no under seat storage and were as narrow as the economy seats, and 2 on the back row where we were constantly bothered by the adjacent toilets. Only 1 loo each side between the economy and economy plus meant that there were always queues of people leaning against us. Cabin pressure was uncomfortably low, overnight temperature was stifling hot and few people got any sleep at all. Breakfast was a hard cold half sandwich with a hurried cup of tea or coffee. Impossible to get any drinks or refreshments between the service rounds.

they assigned me a middle seat,31 reviews,22/01/2019,United States," I understand completely why there is air rage in the skies when companies such as BOAC go out of their way to make the travel experience an stressful and unpleasant as is humanly possible. I paid $813 to fly r/t LAX-BUH and yet they want an extra $150 to have a desirable seat. I understand if you check-in 24 hours before departure you receive a seat from those available, but why is it they assign you the worst seat available when betters are there? In my case, they assigned me a middle seat on a 787 when both of the adjacent aisle seats are available to assign. It is baffling. The ground crew and the inflight staff are excellent but can do little with the oppressive business decisions their executives make - everything comes down to make every penny they can. And why am I flying BOAC? They owed me £25 from the last flight b/c the inflight entertainment system was inop for 1/2 the cabin and so we all had to sit in the dark with nothing to do for a twelve-hour flight. On top of that, their seats have so little padding and cushion that only the plumpest can sit in their seats longer that 15"". For normal-sized adults, it is as agonising as the rack must've been.

The PE seats are more comfortable than economy, the extra 4 inches of width make a huge difference.

extremely run down and shabby,1 reviews,19/01/2019,United Kingdom,"  Bangalore to London. Ground experience not great - at LHR automated bag drop didn't work and it wasn't clear why; slow-to-react assistance eventually came and identified travel visa to India needed to be validated. At BLR, no online check-in available and slow process. Plane decor extremely run down and shabby, various pieces of the interior trim (bulkheads etc) rattling  and latches for bassinet shelves not locking. Row 12 so bulkhead seat and legroom excellent, however this comes with the hassle of not being able to leave anything on the floor for takeoff and landing; the stowage racks are never big enough to hold the blanket and pillow provided. Seat itself could have more width (I kept bumping the VOD control and I'm quite slim), recline limited and footrest could extend more. No USB power in seat which seems crazy in this day and age. VOD itself is atrocious; tiny screen (folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats), low resolution, visible gridlines and very little choice (hardly the latest movies). To top it off, on outbound leg the VOD stopped working altogether and resisted many resets. Customer service forms were handed out so I await the outcome of that. Food volume OK, quality poor (scrambled eggs in breakfast smelled terrible!), plenty of drinks on outbound leg but not inbound, cabin staff seemed indifferent on inbound leg.

They had more width than the cramped Boeing 747-400 that we had just flown in on. We each had a carry on; however, during the transit process, British Airways ground staff made us check one of our carry on bags.  I have no idea what criteria they used to select passengers to check their carry on bags. Bare bones service, no meals (which is okay), no complimentary soft drinks or water.

Thank you British Airways,M Cheyle,09/01/2019,South Africa,"  London to Johannesburg. So impressed by the lady that checked us in. Something went wrong with my booking, I was supposed to fly at 18:10 (with my boyfriend) back home to South Africa after our visit in UK, but somehow my ticket was booked at 21:10. We didn’t even notice that until she had brought it up at the check-in. I was so shocked by the fact that I would be traveling all by myself (It’s my first trip overseas). She was so willing to help and she fixed it within a matter of 1 minute. We obviously thought that we would not be able to sit next to each other. With grateful hearts we were checking in our bags. When she gave us our boarding passes she mentioned that we have the best seats on the aircraft! How awesome is that!

offer some additional comfort,R Barsat,07/01/2019,United States,"  Newark to Bangalore return via London on BA premium economy (World Traveler Plus). I paid about 40% more for premium economy (about $600 extra) so approximately $150 per leg. Was it worth it? I'd say broadly yes, though I wouldn't want to pay very much more than that and it would be harder to justify if only one leg of 6-7 hours was involved. Before Boarding: Premium economy does get a standard 2 checked bag allowance whereas economy is 1 bag though there are numerous exceptions where they allow 2 (and India to US/Canada is one of those exceptions though it isn't clear if it applies for travel originating at either end). So I am not sure if I got an extra bag or not but I did use the 2 bag allowance Boarding: You board in Zone 3 after First/Business & the oneworld elites. That is helpful as you do get dibs on the overhead storage - if it doesn't fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begins boarding. This means you also get off fairly quickly - which can help if you're in a hurry to get through security at Heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigration at your final destination. In Flight: There is a welcome drink for premium economy (champagne, juice, water depending on the departure time). There is also a hot towel service also. 787 cabin: The 787-9 has a nicely done premium economy cabin. 2-3-2 seating as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. So a somewhat wider seat. Seat pitch is also decent. These are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seats - but seat was comfortable. The food tray comes out of the armrest and there is some seat back storage (though not much). There is a small drinks tray built into the front of the arm rest which you share with your neighbor. There is a recliner style footrest with support for the calf. You do get a noise canceling headset which is nice and a basic amenities kit with eyeshades, socks and toothpaste. The seat back screen is large and easy to use. There is no restroom in the cabin but one immediately behind in economy - so not a long walk 777 cabin: 777 has a 2-4-2 seating in premium economy (same as club world) as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. The 777 version used on the LHR-BLR sector has a very small premium economy cabin - just 3 rows of seats. This gives it a sort of cosy feel. You do have to walk all the way through the economy section immediately behind you to get to the restroom. Economy looked pretty full on both the legs on the 777 but premium economy was not full - and I had the seat next to me vacant on both legs. That helped me stretch out for sure. The seat back screen on the old 777 is much smaller and the seats are older but possibly more cushioned than the slimmer 787 seats. Food: Nothing much here. I didn't think it was all that different from what a regular economy meal would have been. It was OK - nothing to write home about. All in all, for such a long journey, the premium economy product did offer some additional comfort along with the early boarding and baggage. Worth it on extra long haul like US to India. Bit harder to justify on shorter flights or fewer legs.",Boeing 787-9 / 777 ,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Newark to Bangalore via London,01/12/2018,yes,Verified,4,4,4,4,4,3,4
British Airways customer review,5 reviews,05/01/2019,United Kingdom,"  London to Mumbai. I have had my battles with the leadership at BA because they would not let me book my seat and pay with their Airmiles. Now they have finally relented and this will please many who earn Airmiles through their credit cards. This is just to illustrate that I boarded BA199 with a slightly negative mindset, a mindset which was changed quickly. Although I travelled Economy, the seat was comfortable, the service excellent, as was the food. If I have a minor quibble, the choice of films seems to have been reduced with many quite old. Is this BA's attempt to reduce costs, because it is quite obvious and detracts from the overall quality of their product. I was particularly impressed with the trouble the cabin staff took to warn us not to take any single-use plastic (e.g. water bottles, duty-free carrier bags) into the terminal where they could result in a stiff fine. Having been grumpy about several aspects of BA's service in the past, I will be writing to the leadership to thank them for the improvements.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Mumbai,01/12/2018,yes,Verified,7,5,5,5,5,4,3
gave us some First Class goodies,H Neale,02/01/2019,United Kingdom,"  Our return journey from Sydney to London, which was approximately 22 hours in duration with a stop at Singapore airport, was faced with one major issue. We flew economy class with a two year old, whose inflight entertainment headphone socket wasn’t working. Having paid £723 for our two year olds ticket, you would except the inflight entertainment to be working on such a long flight. Having complained to the cabin crew they did their best but unfortunately the socket could not be fixed. We were offered to move seats to the only 2 seats available however there were three of us so this was not practical. The cabin crew gave us some First Class goodies including a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused and they also said that all they could offer us in monitory terms was £25. They said they would contact BA customer services on our behalf to complain and to expect more compensation than what the crew could offer us. By the time we had got off the plane and were in baggage claim, I had already received an email from BA C/S and that they would respond within 48 hours, which they did. However, all the could offered was a £20 voucher to use on another BA flight. I replied declining this and said this was as insult to what we had originally paid for the flight and explained what the cabin crew had said. I also said I had no intention of booking any foreseeable flights with any airline therefore an eVoucher is worthless to me. There was no other alternative or any means of reasoning. The flight was basic and the seats were uncomfortable. BA also offer WiFi on the plane but when you try to use it, they charge £4.99 per hour in economy class.",Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Heathrow to Sydney via Singapore,01/12/2018,no,Verified,3,1,3,2,2,2,1
the cabin was modern and clean,6 reviews,30/12/2018,Thailand," I had flown British Airways from Leeds Bradford to London Heathrow as a part of my journey back home (Thailand) on the 12th December 2018. I arrived at Leeds Bradford 3 hours early so there wasn't a queue at the check-in counter. Check-in process took less than a minute as I already done online check-in, this means I just dropped my luggage. The staff at the airport were very friendly and helpful. I passed through the security control and waited for my aircraft. Boarding process is a mess as there wasn't priority boarding (I flew economy) and no boarding groups, luckily every passenger could board through front and rear door (as the aircraft parked on a remote stand). The aircraft was old but the cabin was modern and clean. The seat was comfortable and had a good wing view. The only downside was the seat was the second to last row at the back so the seat pitch was short (luckily I was only 176m tall so this wasn't a problem). The aircraft was delayed due to slow boarding process and the weather condition, but the crew were very friendly and very helpful. The captain always announce an information for whole flight to let all passenger know the cause of delay and flight information. As the flight departed the crew started on board service. I didn't buy anything as the food option was poor, expensive and they can only be paid by credit cards. It was one hour flight so I didn't expect the top service standard. The flight arrived at London Heathrow on time despite some traffic. Overall, the flight service and crew made this flights enjoyable and to improve this the food and the boarding process should be better.",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Leeds Bradford to London Heathrow,01/12/2018,yes,Verified,9,3,5,-1,5,4,-1
most uncomfortable plane,1 reviews,29/12/2018,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Tenerife. This aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring! G-MEDK is by far the most uncomfortable plane I have ever been on. I paid extra for an extra leg room seat - 12A because I always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight. I reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal. It was like sitting on concrete! I would imagine that when this aircraft was new (2005 I believe) the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of backsides compressing the padding, it was dreadful. I took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in Lanzarote which, coupled with there being no passengers next to me, made the flight in 11F a little more bearable. Staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time I returned at night ten days later. I normally travel Easyjet on this route but on this occasion, I used some Avios to make the flight less expensive. Easyjet offer two trolley runs but only 1 on these BA flights. With their diminishing attitude to customer welfare, I will not use BA on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by Easyjet is, in my experience, far superior.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Tenerife,01/12/2018,no,Not Verified,10,1,3,4,5,3,-1
a total disappointment,18 reviews,24/12/2018,South Africa,"  Johannesburg to London. I had a bulkhead seat on the upper deck. The only advantage is that nobody will step over you during the night. BA has been using the same configuration of seats in business for the last 20 years, and it is time for them to step up their game if they want to keep people flying with them. The business class seat is not wider than the premium economy seat, the difference is that it goes to a full bed. There is no room or to put down a glass other then taking out the table. As it was a late flight (10pm), the crew decided not to offer pre-dinner drinks. I ordered the quick meal option in order to get more sleep. Big mistake: you only get the appetiser (tiny) and the desert (even smaller). I was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crew. The trays are removed when everyone else finishes, so much for getting more sleep. The crew never came back until breakfast.

Was very excited for this trip as BA has made a come back to fly to Malaysia after stopping the service for many years. I paid to seat at the first row to have a longer leg room. I absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choice. I made a complaint to the crew that my seat (30B) has sunk and I felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next 13 hours. Crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. The tv screen on 30B was also not working and I didn't watch anything during the whole duration of the flight. I would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time. This will be my last time flying with BA unless the aircraft is changed to perhaps the A380. I am dreading on my next return flight back to London. Crews were friendly and helpful.

so much BA could do to improve,Clive Drake,22/12/2018,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Barbados. We flew out of Gatwick on the 6th December and back on the 17th Dec. It started well in the newish 1st Class lounge at the South terminal. However, the walk to the gate is miles. It has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be honest. The North terminal, where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight, the decor and layout is much, much better. I'd guess BA got offered a cheaper deal to move to the S.T. My first impression was how badly the ""new"" 1st Class is holding up. There are scuff marks everywhere. Surface scratches. Bobbles of wear on the seat fabric. It's probably under 5 years of use but looks more like 10. In the WC there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains. Needs a paint job at least. The motley flowers (That BA removed some years ago to save costs, but re-instated) are there. They looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard. Much has been said about the seat being ""an up market business class"" - and this is true. It is not a true 1st Class in the sense of what Emirates and Singapore Airlines offer. (I have flown both in 1st). The food is also business class quality. More casual dining rather than fine dining. Taking one meal; it starts with an Amuse Bouche. One motley round mozzarella bit of cheese. One tomato. One bit of green stuff. One straggly piece of prosciutto ham. Total cost about 30p. Outstanding! I then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan. Totally, utterly boring. My wife had the soup which she said was nice. I then had jerk Chicken dish. It was just about okay. The glassware and chinaware was okay. The cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you'd expect in Pizza Express, except the stuff in Pizza Express is better. I accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much BA could do to improve the ""cheap"" look of their premium product. Quality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu covers. They trumpet the ""superb"" Laurent Perrier Grand Siecle champagne, which retails at £120 a bottle. Its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most Airline 1st Class offer in Krug. £20 a bottle more! The alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang Club Business Class. The world's most hated Business Class in the sky. I'm a businessman and i know I could run this airline better, from a quality perspective. From a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st Flight as part of a BA holiday, it sort of works out okay-ish.

Awful seating with their Ying/Yang seating arranged like sardines in a tin. Poor cabin staff attitude - I asked for my seat to be made up into an bed only to be told ""We only do that in First class - if we did that for you we would have to do that for everyone in the cabin and we do not have the staff for that"". I was almost asleep when I was disturbed by food/drinks being passed through the serving hatch (otherwise known as a privacy screen) to the inner seat - This happened 3 times, a sort of sleep deprivation torture.

would not recommend BA,J Leeson,18/12/2018,Australia,"  Sydney to London via Singapore. I'm hugely disappointed with the Business class trip. The seating arrangements leave little to be desired, i.e. if you are on the isle you're interrupted by the cabin crew passing food through to or collecting the tray from the person sitting on the inside of you (refer to seat guru for more understanding). Service is slow and once you have your food, good luck getting rid of your tray for about 45 minutes. If you're next to the window, you need to be extremely athletic to go to the toilet as you have to climb over someone legs in order to get out of your seat. The drinks available from the bar could not be less appealing if they tried and good luck trying to get one as the cabin crew are extremely elusive. If you do get a drink, be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray, I had two drinks slip off the Teflon type surface and spill all over my arm and seat. Dont get me started with the in-flight entertainment or the lack of it. After I watched two movies (on a 24 hour flight) I was scratching to find anything else decent to watch. The ""new releases"" is a contradiction in terms. There is very little priority giving to Business class when boarding the plane, sure you re called first but because of the plane’s configuration you ultimately have to join the queue to board with the rest of economy. Once you locate your seat you have all of economy filing passed you to get to their seats.

The dinner service was unremarkable, too, and the cheese board had shrunk in size between the two flights. My IFE touchscreen struggled to respond to finger presses and the selection of films was no different to the previous month.

He said I should have put my requests on my account but you can’t account for having the same two options every time you travel and wouldn’t expect them only to have two menus.  The snack before landing was the most disgusting bagel/bun. Totally unacceptable and as for the attitude of the staff, making a bad situation worse. The light didn’t work on my seat so I couldn’t read once the lights went off and the screen was so damaged on my TV, watching was incredibly hard.

Premium Economy is a joke,P Downing,03/12/2018,United Kingdom,"  Nassau to London. Premium Economy on BA is a joke. Highlighted by my Friday morning 7am breakfast. A glass of water and a breakfast box containing a cold, sealed in plastic, Croissant and an equally sealed Banana Bread/Cake. No hot food/drink; awful. That after a night battling with intermittent service on the seat back screen,  a screen no larger than in Economy. The only benefit for the money was early off the plane with luggage prioritised to the collection area. The extra leg room was about OK but the seat was simply uncomfortable for a 6/2 225lb male - yes large but not obese. BA Premium Economy - forget it.

miserable customer service,2 reviews,28/11/2018,Germany,"  San Diego to Hannover via London. I booked on ba.com, the longer flights both ways in premium economy.  On the return I was informed at San Diego that the American Airlines flight into DFW was severely delayed and I would miss my flight into London. American Airlines could book me on a later flight the same day, but had only  coach available. If I insisted on premier economy I could fly in 3 days. I took the coach and American assured my that BA would refund the fare difference for this downgrade. After arrival at home I contacted BA on their website to refund the fare difference. A bizarre exchange followed. First they said you did not buy any upgraded seat. I told them to look at the ticket. You can't get a refund because the economy class seat was much more expensive that the booked premium economy seat. I contacted BA Germany who said you get a refund, but you booked this with a travel agent, so we are not in charge.  I booked with BA on their website. They saidthey would send this to London so they can compute the refund, but then you can't get a refund because your seat was much more expensive than the premium seat you booked months in advance. The change in booking was the sole fault of the delayed American Airlines flight.

an excellent flight,31 reviews,27/11/2018,United Kingdom,"  London to Johannesburg. Turning right to the first wing at T5 was a new experience for us. It was all pretty slick, although the guy at check-in wasn't exactly Mr Convivial. The Concorde Room was impressive, too - particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design, overlooking the main concourse. Boarding involved lining up according to group. This smacked a bit of low-cost airlines, but I guess that's necessary with all the passengers on a double-decker plane. The first cabin on the A380 is definitely more spacious than on a 747 and the 'suites' also had more room and extra storage space. The dividers seemed higher, too, giving better privacy. The fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus. Cabin crew were friendly, attentive and thoroughly professional. Food was good, too, and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly. The wines on offer were a good selection, including the fabulous LPGS, and we enjoyed some wine tasting. Sleep quality was considerably better than Club World, although the cabin temperature was a little high. Overall, an excellent flight that fully met the brief of first class travel.",A380,Couple Leisure,First Class,London to Johannesburg,01/11/2018,yes,Verified,1,5,5,5,4,4,4
the staff were very helpful,S Kane,22/11/2018,Canada,"  Vancouver to London Heathrow. I chose to fly with them because I had been told they were good for families and as I was traveling with my 8 month old alone this was what I needed. The booking process was not smooth and very stressful, I have to call customer service multiple times and they need to improve their customer service call center. The 2 flights were great though, the staff both on the ground and in the air were very helpful and did everything they could to ensure I was doing ok. The crew came around often with drinks and the food was ok I was first given a cot for my baby. I originally wanted a one of the Britax seats they have but was talked out it saying my baby would be more comfortable in the cot, nope! He was too big and could not lie straight so I asked for it to be switched out and he was asleep with 15 minutes. All the toilets in economy were out of order at least 3 hours before we reached our destination so everyone had to used the business class toilets, I'm sure that was annoying for the people seated there and lines were constant.",Boeing 747-400,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to London Heathrow,01/11/2018,yes,Verified,1,5,5,4,5,4,2
space around the seat is cramped,B Worley,20/11/2018,Switzerland,"  Basel to San Fransisco via Heathrow. I'm convinced the quality has dropped considerably in the past several years. I booked World Traveller Plus or Premium Economy which costs appr. twice as much as economy. The flight to SFO was ok seat wise as the plane was an A380 and I has reserved an aisle seat. The food was disgusting for me, during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizza. The choice of food leaves a lot to be desired. There were cold drinks offered regularly and you can go to the bulkhead to get extra if needed. We were offered maybe two hot drinks during the 12 hours on the plane (longer due to a delay leaving the UK). The flight back to the UK was worse since it was a Boeing 747 with the older bulkier seats. You couldn't even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and I'm not big. The recliner didn't work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat. I feel sorry for larger people. The food was just as bland and poor and barely any warm drinks. The staff seem challenged with certain situations.

Instead of asking was something wrong or would I like another meal option, the FA took the tray away and asked if I wanted dessert. Wine 2 reds 2 whites and 2 champagnes - hardly a stellar wine list. Entertainment small screen with dreadful resolution and a very limited ordinary range of options. Staff challenged at best, clearly some had not been in business before. Disengaged and disinterested. The cabin was over hill for me. The toilet was not checked very often, a sweet wrapper remained on the toilet floor the entire trip as did an overflowing rubbish bin.

The cabin crew were welcoming and very professional in their appearance and demeanor too. The cabin was spotlessly clean and the flight departed on time and arrived slightly early.

I was disappointed,52 reviews,25/10/2018,United States,"  London to Philadelphia. I upgraded from coach to business for almost $900 because I  wanted to experience BA’s business class in the Boeing 787, but I was disappointed. While the aircraft was new, the staff really could have cared less about the business guests. 2-3-2 in business with some seats facing the cockpit and others the tail. BA lost me as a traveler because the crew although polite, service wise was lacking. Pre-flight they offer you a beverage, I asked for rose champagne and I was told “I guess I have to go find a bottle and open one”. In my previous business class experiences there are beverages served every 2 hours, not on this almost 8 hour flight. I was served my main meal almost 2.5 hours after takeoff. You get one full hot meal and a snack one hour and a half before landing. You also get an initial beverage and then the next time a beverage is offered is 1.5 hours before landing. If you ask for anything else to drink in between you have to go into the galley. Yes they have the menu, linen, silverware and glass but you feel like they just have to do this for you and not like they want to do this for you. Because of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortable. There was virtually no storage other than a small laptop droor and that’s it. I have to say the entertainment options were very good and there was no Wi-Fi on this flight. You get a pillow, duvet and blanket and a decent amenity kit. BA has the new planes, and decent business amenities however they lost me in the service. I will not pay to upgrade to business on BA and will avoid flying with them if I have another option.

BA club world is a farce,1 reviews,15/10/2018,United Kingdom,"  London to Los Angeles. Booked this trip eight months previously and as I lost my status on BA a few years ago were forced to pay an additional £180 for our two seats. The flight I chose was a Boeing 787 and was prepared to part with the extra cash so we could be in the small front cabin. Never expecting anything to go according to plan with BA and our flight was cancelled a few days before. We were rebooked onto a later flight which they changed from an A380 to a twenty one year old Jumbo. We were then seated right at the back of Club World to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premium. We were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he would be looking after us for the trip, he then disappeared never to be seen again. Food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight. The steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces off. After a few hours I went  to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared, stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses. Reluctantly one stopped chattering and managed to get me a drink. The second meal was served about seven hours after lunch, steak sandwich, at least that one was edible. The seat was as you would expect on such an old plane totally knackered, getting out was a task in itself. I bought WiFi for the whole trip, it ran for about 50% of the flight, yet their customer (non existent) services refuse to refund the payment even though I sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service, but they are happy to note the problems. We have avoided BA now for some time, except where there is no other option as on Club Europe. But with transatlantic they are probably the bottom of the pile. We only took this trip to use up some Avios, they have all been used now and we could come back from LAX on Virgin Atlantic.

BA lacks consistency,Gordon Smith,13/10/2018,United Kingdom,"  Miami to London Heathrow. As with many others whom have posted reviews on this site my issue is with BA's customer service when dealing with an issue that has arisen from flying on this once proud airline. My issue was with faulty equipment onboard. Issue with my seat that the onboard team tried to the best of their ability to sort but unable to through no lack of effort and have nothing but praise for these guys working with aging equipment and keep on trying to do their best to keep the customer happy. Had to move seat and as first, club and premium economy all full, had to move back to economy. Asked customer services to refund me the fare difference for this part of the journey and after several cut and past generic replies on their part and fed up hitting my head off a brick wall have given up as life is too short to fight profits over customer satisfaction organisation. Following a favourable review of my outward journey it is clear BA lacks consistency and don't wish to deal with issue when something goes wrong.

The breakfast we had in the lounge was just about OK. The South lounge was rammed. We took off on time and I declined a cooked breakfast.

We had a very good lunch with the new Club Europe menu which came into effect two days earlier. A nice prawn cocktail and a very nice coronation Chicken. Downed a couple of G&Ts. FAs on both flights were great. There has been a massive improvement here on the catering side. The seating is still hopeless. Three seats between two and zero legroom.

BA34 KUL-LHR 6 Sept, return BA11 LHR-SIN-KUL on 16 Sept. All flights in World Traveller Plus with the exception of SIN-KUL on MH economy. On the KUL-LHR leg, the aircraft was clean and spacious in the PY cabin. The seats were the biggest let down. Whilst there was adequate legroom, they were hard and uncomfortable, especially when reclined with virtually no lumbar support. The headrest did not move at all. The seats taper at the waist which is odd and given that they are quite wide, there is very little storage apart from the usual pocket which I think is a missed opportunity by BA to maximise utilisation of space. The food was okay, you get two meals, the first being quite substantial but the second was a joke. IFE was okay but the best part of the journey was the staff who were pleasant and obliging. The return flight was on an A380. Excellent boarding procedure as it was a full flight. Again, seats were the same but the A380 has that wonderful storage space on the upper cabin. Staff were less conspicuous this time around. Overall, I would recommend them but attention needs to be paid to their seats.","Boeing 787-9, A380",Business,Premium Economy,Kuala Lumpur to London Heathrow,01/09/2018,yes,Verified,4,3,4,3,5,4,3

experience is so lacklustre,31 reviews,17/09/2018,United Kingdom,"  Brindisi to London. Flying from any airport that includes Ryanair among its serving airlines has to be a bad sign. Brindisi airport is at least modern but it makes few concessions to comfort and there was certainly no lounge for Club Europe passengers. There was also no priority check-in, or, indeed, priority anything. Boarding was a fiasco, with two lines directed into pens, pending the mad dash to the plane, which then entailed using a rather weird, tiered set of steps that was just another queue. Service in Club Europe commenced efficiently, but the cabin crew were of the breezy, cheery type who'd have been better suited to Ryanair. The brief drinks service over, it was on to the the much-vaunted, new look Club Europe meal service. Sadly, this proved to be just another cost-cutting, exercise, with everything piled on to the tiny plastic tray at once, and the appetiser and cheese 'courses' reduced to microscopic portions in little pots. And, of course, the seats haven't changed, although, interestingly, BA seem intent on packing ever more passengers into the Club Europe section, which means that the service is little different to the old economy. Still, we arrived only 30 minutes behind schedule and the priority tags did result in our bags coming off the belt within only a few minutes. It's just that the whole inflight experience is so lacklustre and un-business-like.",A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Brindisi to London,01/09/2018,no,Verified,3,1,2,2,1,2,-1
dreadful seats by the toilet,C Thane,16/09/2018,United Kingdom,"  Chicago to London. I have flown long haul many times with both BA and Virgin premium economy. In my view whilst the Virgin product has improved, the BA equivalent has deteriorated such that Virgin is significantly better. Despite booking and paying for seats with BA this got changed without notification and we ended up in the back of WT+ on the A380 which are dreadful seats by the toilet with limited recline on an overnight flight. For the first time in many years I found the food inedible and the service not great (for example no cutlery initially on tray, no food choice as had run out of other choice, one drink serving and no where to get water on flight). Went through 3 layers of customer service with BA on seat booking issue but consistently fobbed off.

a surprisingly good flight,H Larson,15/09/2018,United States,"  Rome to Newark via London. The first sector was on a A319. Flight was a tiny bit delayed but arrived on time. Boarding at FCO was initially by groups and then a free for all after groups 1 and 2. Flight attendants friendly and welcoming. Seat comfort was pretty good with the leather seats though legroom was tight. There was really nothing to set this flight apart from any other low cost carrier as everything had to purchased - even water. No entertainment either. Was prepared for this so packed a lunch from the airport which was better than what appeared to be on the M&S menu. Connection at T5 was smooth as anything given our arrival mid afternoon. Boarding for the flight to Newark was organised and painless. I was dreading this 787 flight a little based on my previous experience with another airline where it felt cramped. Happy to say, the seat comfort was pretty good, legroom was manageable. I was however surprised that for a 2 year old aircraft (i checked), it was pretty dirty. There was grime around the USB port (which didn't work), tv screen and along the floor by the wall. The cushion on the seatback in front appeared to be busting out the sides as well. I found the touchscreen IFE to be outdated and slightly slow in response. The selection was not as extensive but I did find some excellent British content that I had not seen before. The real standout was the cabin crew who were all somewhat senior but their experience shone through in just how consistently friendly, professional and warm they were with their service. They were generous with drinks and very efficient and quick. The main meal was decent though the pre arrival snack of sandwiches were a little dry and disappointing.

This was a great flight,D Kemble,12/09/2018,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Dubai. This was the first time I had flown in first class  on BA. I had read many reviews before travelling and they were somewhat mixed. BA's first class cabin is not even close to the best in the skies but then again it isn't the same price and reward tickets are readily available if you are a little bit flexible on dates. We were on a 777 which is probably one of the oldest in the BA fleet. The cabin was clean but a little bit tired in places but the seat was very comfortable and spacious. The sleep suit and amenity kit were great with lots of little touches to make you more comfy. It is nice they offer a male and female kit, my wife was delighted with the contents. The Champagne that BA offer in first is superb. I enjoyed a couple of glasses in the lounge and some on board and it is probably the best champagne I have tasted. Choice of other wines is good too and a particular treat is the Johnnie Walker Blue Label if you are a whiskey drinker. Food was very tasty and well presented. I had a seared prawn amuse bouche followed by poached baby pear with blue cheese and walnut brittle then Lamb Machboos as a main course and finally chocolate mille feuille. We were offered ice creams a hour or two later and then afternoon tea a couple of hours before landing. I cant really fault any of it. It was the best airline food i have ever eaten and better than a number of restaurant meals too. IFE was decent although the screen has to folded away so no entertainment during take off or landing,. I believe this has been rectified in later versions of this seat fitted to the 787. I do wish they had a full series of a show rather than just some random episodes but there was plenty of choice. The thing that really made this flight special were the cabin crew. From the moment we stepped on board until we deplaned they were fabulous. Attentive with out being over-bearing. Witty and charming but still professional and always available to attend to your every need. They were superb. Wifi was available but the page to connect didn't load up when i tried it. I dint really pursue it to be honest as i was happy to enjoy the other pleasures first had to offer. This was a great flight and i would wholly recommend that you try out first.

staff were very efficient,38 reviews,10/09/2018,Brazil," Flew Madrid to London Heathrow. The 767 is ancient and BA have clearly given up on hiding that fact, I guess they will be phasing these old but great planes out of service soon. I love flying in 767s, the configurations are generally very comfortable but to be honest the plane was really dated and BA should definitely improve this. Aside from this the flight was really very good indeed. BA Business class has in my experience always been consistent, consistently good. BA cabin crew in Business class are a real asset. This was one of BA's more traditional crews and they create a very agreeable atmosphere. The flight was very busy but the staff were very efficient and the loading on the flight did not prejudice the overall experience.

The A321 was relatively new and clean, no pre-take-off drinks were offered. Departure was delayed by about 30 minutes but arrival was on time. The Club Europe section was unusually busy, with at least ten, fully occupied rows, including families with pre-school children.

British Airways is a rip off,13 reviews,08/09/2018,United Kingdom," I have BA silver membership. This promises fast track, choice of seats at booking, priority boarding and lounge access. I would advise all travellers that in reality these benefits are intermittent at best and unavailable at worst. The majority of the time my seat choice is changed, fast track at Heathrow is slower than the normal queue, and the lounges so overcrowded that it's sometimes hard to find a seat. The Iberia lounge at Madrid is equality poor, with stale tortilla the only offering at breakfast. British Airways is a rip off. I have uploaded by way of example a seat map of their A321 and seat 22c. This seat is not extra legroom and is cramped like the others. Yet on BA.com they will try to sell it as an exit seat as if it has extra legroom.

IFE was the size of my wallet,H Fanzen,29/08/2018,Germany,"  Washington to Frankfurt via London. Check-In at Dulles Airport was smooth. I asked the agent if it was possible to get a window seat and she did, even though at the online check-in there was none available. Boeing 747-400 was 27 years old, the IFE was the size of my wallet and the quality was incredibly bad. The seats were ok, pretty standard but they had a head rest which was good. My seat was 27A and I had the whole row for myself. Unfortunately a crew member shortly before take-off told me that another passenger had issues with his IFE and they would replace him on 27C. Shortly after take-off the service began. There were 2 food options available. Chicken and vegatarian lasagne, I went for the Lasagne which was ok, nothing special. It came with a salad, a bread bun and a black forest cake. All in all an ok meal, nothing to complain about. The crew distributed 2 mini cans of soda which was a bit unsatisfying. After dinner the crew dimmed the lights and we were supposed to close the window shades for the people who wanted to sleep. I tried to watch some movies (the selection was ok) which was hard on this miniature IFE. In the morning the crew served orange juice and before landing a pretzel with cheese and a small water bottle. Connecting in Heathrow is pretty easy (in T5) there are signs everywhere! Security went fast. There is a huge quiet zone with battery chargers and free WIFI. We boarded again in groups which was good to avoid crowds. BA started to do a buy-on-board service which I hate.

the quality becomes worse,S Andrews,21/08/2018,United Kingdom," London to Athens. Since I started using BA in 2011, I can only say that the quality becomes worse. The leg room in Business Class in A320 is the same like in economy. The only thing that you get is an empty middle seat. The meal choices are poor: I had to choose between curry and fish pie. Also, they first brought us the starter and the dessert and after 5-10 mins (once we ate the starter), they took the starter plate and they gave us the main. The on board service, is less 'attentive' than some years ago (probably cabin crew are over-utilised and want to get some rest which is understandable). Also, due to the plane being late, the cabin was not cleaned properly. At some point we need to think why would someone choose BA over low cost airlines. Tickets are priced in a similar way, there is no food on board for the economy (while for business the portion and variety are a joke), leg space is small, there are always delays to depart from Heathrow (not BAs fault, but at the end of the day I experience delays).

thoroughly recommend it,6 reviews,21/08/2018,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Singapore. Had a great experience in the Concorde Room, and Galleries First lounges in Heathrow T5. I was warmly greeted by a member of the crew, who held me aside and took me into the cockpit to meet the flight crew and have a look around, all because I expressed a slight interest, and for that I am thankful. The flight crew were very friendly and it was nice to see what goes on in the cockpit. The seat was very well presented, there was a small amenity kit, as well as a pair of pyjamas. The seat was clean with pillows, as well as ample storage space. You get a closet to hang clothes, a little compartment next to the seat, as well as the overhead bin, so I never ran out of room. The pre-departure beverage was a choice of water, orange juice, or champagne and hot towels were handed out. The flight left slightly behind schedule, but at Heathrow, this is something you expect. Very soon after take-off, the crew began serving dinner. I had already booked my meal in advance, but the choice of starters, mains and deserts, as well as the beverage menu, was very good. The meal I had was exceptionally tasty and I would have it again! Once dinner service had finished, the crew turned down the bed for me, whilst I went and changed into the comfortable pyjamas that were provided. The bed was very comfortable and at just over 6 feet tall, I did not have any issues fitting into the bed and stretching out. There were plenty of blankets and pillows available and I slept very well. When I awoke, I was offered coffee and a short while later, breakfast. The breakfast choices were continental, or cooked. I opted for the cooked option and I was not disappointed, as it was very tasty, and there was a lot of it. The inflight entertainment was good, and there was a large range of films, TV programmes/series, audio books, and kids programmes to choose from. The system was responsive and was good quality, although I did not watch any films, so I cannot speak of the sound quality. The crew served with a smile and even when I asked for a Latte, which the machine didn’t do, the crew went out of their way to make one for me which was very nice.

His was delivered, mine was not. When asked, the attendant brought an uncovered tray with the sticker on the tray LSML. Obviously heated up quickly but was lukewarm, dry and I was troubled by the fact it was delivered with no foil covering the food. Not the same as my husbands meal, so I have to take the airlines word LSML that it was low sodium. Attendants serving coffee missed us and when I pressed the call button it was over 15 minutes before a flight attendant showed up. One pass through the cabin for drinks. After that, you had to go to the back of the plane to find an attendant and order a drink. Sandwich served before landing in the evening was horrendous. Hummus, limp piece of lettuce and soggy thin sliced tomatoes made this stale sandwich unappealing and tasteless to say the least. I expected edible food and better, more friendly service with this airline. Our flight attendant was stone faced and seemed curt and bothered each time we asked about my missing meal.

improved on board experience,Mike Palmer,15/08/2018,Canada,"  Toronto to LHR and LGW to Toronto return in WT+. Finally, BA has moved back into it’s own lounge which has been refurbished with new furniture. However, Premium Plaza still staff and operate the lounge. Food was ok – but the drinks choices remain poor. Slick boarding and a full PE cabin on a 777. Water and juice offered on boarding but still no prosecco offered on flights TO London. (apparently 3 are loaded in London for the O/W leg but none for the return.) Friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service. Fast bar service followed by Veggie pasta or chicken stir fry offered which was foul. salty, dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy vegetables. The salad is a nonsense – a few leaves and a tomato slice. Pudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was gross. Got a couple of hours sleep. However the IFE froze after take off due to the PA system remaining locked on and preventing the IFE from working. A reset halfway through the flight worked, though two loud renditions of Delibe’s “flower duet” burst out throughout the aircraft twice waking everyone up. The standard T&Cs and juice and the pretzel roll with cream cheese offered before landing. I continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat it given how awful it is. (BA should be embarrassed that it’s even offered) After leaving Toronto 5 mins late, we arrived 5 early at the gate at Heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags. For the return leg, I took the seasonal LGW to Toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper. An upgrade to Club World was a pleasant surprise. Fast check in at LGW but slow slow slow security – even in the fast track lane. Gatwick Airport sell £5 premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying 5 quid mixed in with BA Fast track customers. Excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food, and champagne available as a help yourself. Efficient boarding and a great reception from the Gatwick cabin crew. A fast offering of champagne (with a top up) before take off though the old safety video was still showing. The Gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from Heathrow – more experienced, faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service. Fast bar service once airborne, followed by the old Biz food service. Overcooked steak (again) alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option. Plenty of wine and drinks along with T&C. After a pleasant 3 hour nap, I woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream – off the menu due to supply issues. At the gate early and fast bags too. This club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service. So new toiletries and bedding but the old menu. I hope Gatwick catches up so BA don’t (unintentionally) promote two levels of Biz service with LGW being the poor relative. On the O/W leg, premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp. The food is truly awful – both dinner and breakfast, and it really wouldn’t take much to add better food, bedding and an enhanced drink service as BA really lag behind Air Canada on this route with premium economy. I do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat. All that said, I felt that BA is regaining it’s mojo with great crew, improved on board experience (cuts reinstated) and on time performance.

Really very good FA's,14 reviews,15/08/2018,United Kingdom,"  San Francisco to London Heathrow on the lower deck of the A380 - a very quiet smooth flight. Did not want to pay the usual BA extortionate seat pre-reservation fees but still got seats together. After the real scrum at the departure gate - no apparent order, struggle to get through to Priority Lane, announcements completely inaudible etc we boarded to the reasonably comfortable, if narrow, seats. Of course the usual BA Club Class ""scramble over the legs"" to get to the aisle and 8 abreast - not really a premium product in today's competitive Business Class World. Welcomed with glass of champagne by attentive FA. OK meal - beef - with decent wines to accompany. Much more up to date touch screen AVOD system but still a dreadful choice of ""blockbuster"" films. Very extensive choice for breakfast - continental and cooked if you wanted it. Really very good FA's - made you feel welcome. Landed on time but baggage, for some reason, took about 3/4 hour to get to the belt. As usual I have mixed feelings about BA - if we are lucky enough to fly Club/Business Class it is comfortable but you do feel a bit let down by the appalling layout and huge charge to pre-reserve seat. If Virgin Atlantic fly the same route I will always choose their Upper Class as everyone has aisle access and you don't have to pay to pre-reserve your seat.",A380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to London Heathrow,01/07/2018,no,Verified,9,4,5,4,4,4,1

 a very acceptable flight,1 reviews,12/08/2018,United Kingdom," This was a night flight New York JFK to London, so it was difficult to assess the service onboard, although what I experienced was certainly not bad. I think this was a very quiet flight, judging from the number of people around the gate, and there were only another 4-5 pax in First. But it's quite hard to tell when wrapped in the cocoons of the Concorde Room and First cabin. The former felt very exclusive but, as commented elsewhere, to the point of being fussy. It's irritating that they don't have any showers in the Concorde Room; I wasn't amused to check in at the Galleries (business) Lounge, be brusquely sent on to Concorde, only to have to return to Galeries upon learning that that were no showers in the former (it was 7pm, early August in NYC - of course I needed a shower!). Departures from NY were running around 3 hours late that evening due to weather, and we were warned about a 60 min taxi to the runway. But we were very well looked after at that point; the cabin wasn't secured until just before takeoff, and the boredom of the taxi was eased by multiple - and very welcome - top-ups of champagne, seved by various members of the crew. Likewise, all the perks of first class were there; I was addressed by name, the crew introduced themselves individually, dinner and drinks orders were taken, etc. All very courteous and professional. After such a long delay, I decided to have some more dinner as I was quite peckish; this came with some excellent wine, and was served promptly, so there was still plenty of time for sleep. But the soup was cold, and the main wouldn't have been out of place in business class. Moreover, it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the BA arrivals lounge at LHR would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination; had I known this, I would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane. A very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience (picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lenses in T5 arrivals toilets...perhaps you saw me?). The cabin layout and bed: well, it's easy to find details of this elsewhere online. But it's certainly nothing special for First Class. Overall, a very acceptable flight, but I felt that the overly-fussy service sometimes got in the way of the practicalities of a short overnight Atlantic crossing (where can I have a shower in the morning? Where will I be having breakfast?). I've had business class flights from other carriers that have absolutely nailed these aspects.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,First Class,New York JFK to London,01/08/2018,no,Verified,9,4,5,3,5,4,-1
let down by the ground services,41 reviews,09/08/2018,United Kingdom,"  Paphos to London Gatwick in Club Europe. We had checked before leaving our hotel and realised that the flight was delayed, as were many other flights, due to bad weather the previous evening in UK. We checked in on time, only to be advised that there was no lounge available for Club Europe passengers and if we wanted to use the premium lounge we could pay! Whilst we appreciate that there may not be a BA lounge it is normal that BA would have an arrangement with the local lounge provider as we have experience at many other airports when travelling in business class. We were offered a €10 voucher each, due to the delayed flight!! Paphos airport was extremely crowded and having paid good money to travel in business class we were very disappointed with BA, that no lounge access was available. The flight itself was OK, although two hours late. The cabin crew provided good service and the meal service reasonable, my wife chose the chilli con carne and I chose the roasted chicken, both were a little dry. On arrival at Gatwick at 01-00 we were through passport control quickly and then waited 45 minutes for the cases to be delivered, again very poor show. BA has some great assets, particularly the cabin crew, but we felt let down by the ground services at both end of this flight Like us many travellers like to travel with a 'full service' airline and in this case BA were lacking.",A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Paphos to Gatwick,01/07/2018,no,Verified,8,3,5,3,1,3,-1
Very happy with the service,41 reviews,09/08/2018,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Paphos in Club Europe. We travelled on the first Saturday of the school holidays and whilst Gatwick was busy the check in for business class was not to bad. We expected the lounge to be busy but there was plenty of free seats. The flight boarded slightly late but we were not long in the take off queue. We are used the BA's Club Europe offering and whilst would prefer a little more leg room the flight was reasonably comfortable. Service from the cabin crew was good. It is nice that BA have gone away from the miniature bottles of wine in Club Europe and now serve by the glass. The meal service was quite good, we both chose the chicken curry for the main course, which was tasty and not dried out. Flight arrived 5 minutes ahead of schedule.

charges to select Business Class seats,E Marston,07/08/2018,United States,"  
New York to Nairobi via London. Flight Attendants were wonderful, friendly, cheery and helpful. But the business Class seats that face aft cause the passenger to have to crawl over the legs of a sleeping stranger, even if you are seated next to a companion. There is no easily accessible storage space by the seat; even for a bottle of water. The IFE on the LHR-NBO leg reminds me of the game ""pong"" in its resolution and food is mediocre, at best.

a good experience with BA,2 reviews,31/07/2018,Germany,"  London to Santiago de Chile. I was flying premium economy with BA and surprised that I got a row (2 seats on the left side) for my own. The seat was spacious and even with an occupied neighbour seat, I would have had enough space to feel very comfortable. However, Lufthansa on the A380 (also Y+) gives a bit more personal space (at least it seems to me). The seat recline was good as well as the ife system (big screen, wide choice of programs of which I chose to listen to some BBC concerts). The crew didn't impress me but was very friendly and helpful. The food was extraordinarily good (the chicken I had was very delicious) with sufficient food (cheese, salad, dessert). The frittata on breakfast wasn't good, however. I didn't like that they sealed the drinks 40 minutes before the arrival (a bit early).  I had a good experience with BA and would definitely fly again as all the things (seat, ground, service, staff) were like expected (the dinner was way above average).

pay again to pre-reserve seats,14 reviews,30/07/2018,United Kingdom,"  Flew a now ageing B777 flight BA 0053 to Seattle. Pleasant flight with actually quite decent fillet steak for main meal. OK choice of wine / beer with meal and greeted with glass of Prosecco when boarded. Comfortable seat BUT it's the old bug bear - 8 across with ""over the legs"" access to the aisle. Fortunately we were in the last row so my wife was in the window seat with direct aisle access. And we could look at each other and not at a total stranger. I know BA are saying that they are introducing direct aisle access for everyone in Club Class but this can't come soon enough - and 8 abreast is not exactly a Premium Product in the present circumstances, is it? Absolutely terrible In Flight Entertainment system - although it was On Demand the aircraft was fitted with a very ancient system: blurry, old screens, awful audio (take your own noise reducing headphones) and a pretty dreadful choice of movies.... FA's great welcoming and gave good service. But the main drawback with BA is their insistence that, having paid for a premium service, we then have to pay handsomely again to pre-reserve our seats (up to £105 per seat per journey!).  Not what I expect from a flag carrier airline. We refuse to pay this extortionate sum - our choices have been noted on the loyalty card scheme and fortunately we have got seats together so far. So, although we had quite a pleasant flight to Seattle with BA in Club, if Virgin Atlantic fly the same route we will choose their Upper Class over Clubworld - we can still reserve our seats for free with them.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to Seattle Tacoma,01/07/2018,no,Verified,8,4,4,4,4,4,2
"overall, it’s a good option",B Robinson,30/07/2018,United Kingdom," Flew London Gatwick to Tirana Rinas. Bag drop at Gatwick was basically seamless, and BA was offering to check in your hand baggage for free. The flight was at 8:10 and the gate was supposed to be shown at 7:24 am, which was oddly specific, but as we got closer to that time, that just got more and more delayed. Until we finally got our gate info at around 7:45. For which boarding had already started. Boarding was pretty much seamless. The cabin crew greeted all the passengers which was nice. The legroom was alright, perfectly fine for a 2 and and a half hour flight. Good recline aswell. I don’t understand why British Airways opted for buy on board, their free food offering before was perfectly fine. Although the food offering was just a few sandwiches which were quite expensive. And there was no real hot food options, just a few of their sandwiches could be served hot. Flights were on time. Flights cost around £320 return per person, which was quite pricey considering the cheapest option was around half the price. So overall, it’s a good option, but if you can find something cheaper, then go for it.",A320-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London Gatwick to Tirana Rinas,01/07/2018,yes,Verified,7,4,4,3,5,3,-1

gone notably downhill,G Meales,28/07/2018,United Kingdom,"  London to Amsterdam. BA's service has gone notably downhill in the past couple of years, but tonight's experience really takes the biscuit. I should now be in Amsterdam - however, I am still writing this from London despite spending over 4 hours on a plane to nowhere. We boarded just about on time, around 1930, only to be told that due to weather there would be a delay of an hour or so. Shortly after, we were told that the routes north of LHR were shut, and no planes were taking off. About an hour into the ordeal, we were told that the airspace had reopened, but there would be a 90 minute wait for a slot. One more hour in, we were told airspace was shut again. After 3 hours, good news! - or so we thought - we were to be on the move around 20 minutes or so later. We did then leave the gate, and we were given the safety briefing and taxied out to the runway. We were then stopped halfway down the taxiway and told that AMS would be shut due to night flight restrictions by the time we would have arrived, so our flight wad cancelled. We taxied back to the gate, where we waited a further 10-15 minutes for ground staff to become available. I must say during this 4 and a quarter odd ordeal, the pilot was informative and tried to stay upbeat, and the cabin crew were very good. The crew gave us the in-flight service (minus alcohol) so we were well fed and watered. This is the full extent of my praise though. Little was I to know that the real disaster was still to come. BA's ground handling was attrocious. We were told to head up to departures for hotel vouchers and rebookings. However, BA had cancelled around 7 flights, and the queues were very lengthy. Vouchers were being handed out to sleep on the floor of a hotel ballroom because ""all the rooms were full"". I have never heard anything like it. This is beyond unbelievable. No assistance for children, elderly, and no preferential treatment for connecting passengers or premium passengers, as is the norm in this situation. Further, the promised ""rebooking"" staff had all gone home - I was told to consult the BA app the following morning. BA's app has rebooked my flights - two days later, when my trip was for three days total. The feature on the app to select a different date for my flights, so I can replan my trip for another weekend, is broken. I guess I'll be trying out their call centre in the morning. This is all simply appalling. We all understand that adverse weather happens. But to keep us on a plane for 4+ hours when they knew before boarding that there would be delays is not on. Moreover, BA surely know the opening hours of their destination airports. Why they could not have prioritised the AMS flight over flights to 24-hour airports I do not know. And as for the ground handling, I have never had an experience this bad. BA staff themselves were thin on the ground - they left most of the work to Heathrow staff, who admittedly tried their best but hid behind the ""we don't work for BA excuse"". I've had a cancelled flight before and yet still wrote the airline involved a glowing review, because they genuinely couldn't have handled it better. By contrast, I don't see how BA could have handled this worse.

I'm not saying they are rude, just that they don't provide a decent level of customer service. You get the basics and good luck if you want to grab their attention. They walk up and down the aisle without making eye contact. No bags at the other end on arrival which I guess you have to live with, however the way they deal with it is appalling.

I was fortunate to travel Hong Kong to London return in Premium Economy recently. Being able to check-in at the downtown Hong Kong Airport Express station is a real bonus as is using the good Qantas Lounge at Hong Kong. I found the on-board service and operations a lot improved over the last time I flew long-haul with BA.. The new Group Boarding sequence system mostly seems to work, although a few of the signs are hidden or bent in the wrong direction so some people had no idea what was going on - but which helped me keep busy assisting people while waiting at the gates. Food and wine on-board was quite good and overall service excellent, including recognising my One World Status. BA has the best in-flight magazine with articles actually worth reading and also has some very clever in-flight programs. I also particularly welcomed the excellent service from 'Goswami' who found me a window seat for LHR-HKG when returning and when using the First Lounge at Heathrow.

food and drink was pretty good,8 reviews,22/07/2018,United Kingdom,"  Faro to Gatwick. Club check in was fairly quick and the priority security worked well at Faro. BA now do have use of a 3rd party lounge here, which sadly is absolutely awful! It feels like an average office canteen, with no comfortable chairs and only just enough seats at all for everyone there. It’s really very tiny and is the only lounge for all the airline as well as lounge schemes like priority pass etc. Considering this is the only lounge in a massive brand new airport, it’s a pathetic offering. Food was minimal and basic, drinks were pretty limited and they barely ever had any glasses or plates available. Whilst BA do provide priority boarding, they do not offer any form of priority to enter the gate and there is always a large queue for this. Once on board, I have similar comments to my outbound flight.. in my opinion they should provide a better welcome, a welcome drink and hand out menus prior to take off. Overall food and drink offering was pretty good on this flight, although cabin crew could have been a bit friendlier.. at one point I dropped one of my headphones and it bounced several rows forward under someone else’s seat. I was looking around for a while to find it and at no point did the crew offer to help at all, instead just looking mildly annoyed that I was temporarily blocking the aisle in order to retrieve it.

a decent enough flight,8 reviews,22/07/2018,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Faro. Club check in at Gatwick is very quick and easy, and fastrack security is also very efficient and we were quickly through to the club lounge. The lounge itself is really nice, spacious enough to have plenty of seating available, and different types of seating, but it also feels very cosy and welcoming. The lounge was clean and tidy and there were pretty good food options available.. including some lovely scones with clotted cream and jam. As always the drinks offering in BA lounges was great. The new boarding by group seems to be working quite well and BA staff are finally enforcing the priority system.. long may it continue! On board was the usual club Europe offering.. which while not exactly luxury is standard for Europe now and for a 3 hour flight is fine. BA don’t ever seem to offer a welcome drink on short haul flights which was a shame as there is plenty of time after the initial boarding rush is complete, there was also no personal welcome or greeting of any kind.. it’s a quick and simple gesture that should be done on any decent carrier. I would also like to see menus handed out before take off, which could be done at the same time as a welcome. The food and drink offering on board is reasonable although food was typically over cooked and with sloppy presentation. Overall a decent enough flight and for a reasonable price, but a few small touches would make it feel much better.",A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Gatwick to Faro,01/07/2018,yes,Verified,3,3,4,3,5,4,-1

not provided any explanation,Barrie Lancaster,12/07/2018,China,"  Luggage broken into – no explanation. First the good point. Cabin attendants were very diligent and friendly in business class on BA169 London to Shanghai on 22 June. Not so good. The bizarre seating pattern that allows 8 business class seats across the width of the plane feels cramped and crowded compared to a herringbone arrangement. The trust breaker. Upon arrival in Shanghai I was not the only one from BA169 reporting missing luggage. Mine arrived 3 days later and the zip locking mechanism had been forced open and damaged beyond repair or further use. Nothing was missing, so was it subject to search as unaccompanied luggage? People deserve an answer when luggage arrives in that state. BA have not provided any explanation despite queries to Customer Relations; this is not acceptable.

Our new seats were shown as exit row seats and we therefore assumed that they would be extra leg room but upon boarding we realised that row 22 of an A321 aircraft is standard seat pitch. Why didn't BA notify us of a seat change when they knew of this change weeks in advance of our flight? Once we'd boarded we found that there was one extra leg room seat still available which was fortunate because my husband is tall and needs that extra leg room.

I think there are many other airlines out there with a first class product which is much better than that I experienced on British Airways. Unless a first class ticket on British Airways is on sale, I would suggest you fly with another airline.

satisfied with all aspects,Ian Graham,27/06/2018,Netherlands,"  Delhi to London. Having read many negative reviews about British Airways I boarded my flight fully expecting to have a bad experience, but ended up feeling completely satisfied with all aspects of the flight. It is all too easy to glamourise the old days but in its seeming decline British Airways is no different to other European airlines. As a resident of the Netherlands I hear Dutch people saying exactly the same about KLM, their national airline, and french friends say the same about Air France. The onboard service was efficient and friendly, if a little lacking in charm. The food was more than adequate. The in-flight entertainment was adequate too. I'm not sure if the extra one pays for Economy Plus is really worth it in terms of better food, but if space and the quietness that comes with a smaller cabin matters, then it is worth it. When we landed at Heathrow, a shortage of ground staff meant that we were stuck in the plane for 40 minutes before someone could be found to operate the bridge to let us off. Those people with connecting flights were naturally beginning to panic, but the crew handled the situation admirably.

seat was below my expectation,W James,25/06/2018,United Kingdom," When you travel British Airways its like you are lucky to be able to be with British Airways staff. Right from the start the check in girl on business told us the flight was closed which was a load of rubbish 1 hour and 10 minutes before the flight. She spent ten minutes on the phone to someone to see if it was too late. Because I need special assistance they didn't have anyone to push my wheelchair so my wife had to do it. My wife now very stressed and I arrive at the finger and when we could see that everyone was still there I asked the man on the desk about being closed and he said nonsense. My wife says thanks for the unnecessary stress. The guys on the desk were great and offered to push my chair which was actually quite a long way. The cabin layout has 7 seats across whereas all the other 787's I have been on have 6. That means they are squeezing in another seat and it is very, very narrow the cabin crew knocking my arm every time they passed by. Of course the 787 is a great aircraft. So for me the seat was below my expectation. I was also amazed that I had to pay £190 to reserve seats, I don't pay anything with other airlines. The food was just OK nothing exciting and the choice of films was not that great but then that is all personal choice. In my opinion fly with a different airline if you can there are seriously better airlines who don't have snobs working for them.",Boeing 787(9),Couple Leisure,Business Class,Seychelles to London,01/06/2018,no,Verified,10,2,3,3,1,1,3

not worth the name anymore,Nigel Johnson,25/06/2018,Canada,"  BA First Class is not even that any more. Starting with the lounge in T3; this may be an offshoot of the fine Concorde Room in T5, but it need not feel like a rural train station. Poor food, average drinks and an indifferent staff do not compare with LH facilities in FRA or MUC. There is no ground assistance, and boarding was haphazard. Fine Cornish champagne was offered and happily quaffed. The seat was OK, but not in the same class as the new AC J class pods, and not close to the Emirate's suites. Small things like the menu presentation, boarding sufficient food (there are a lot of seats in F), seat comfort (OK, but nothing special) and the toilets (small and curiously offering single-ply paper). The crew were very friendly; the service was decent in delivery, but poor overall. BA, your relentless drive to the bottom is catching up with you, and your First Class product is not worth the name anymore. One can only assume that BA are trying to phase it out as they drive any paying passengers to other airlines who place a serious effort to deliver a superb premium product.

experience has deteriorated significantly,William Steward,22/06/2018,United Kingdom, I have flown British Airways numerous times over many years. Sadly the experience has deteriorated significantly recently and this flight was particularly poor. The staff were offhand and one seemed particularly unhappy to be there. The person next to me and I asked for the beef choice but were told that there was none left - too little had apparently been loaded. There was no apology and we were simply told we needed to make another choice. We asked for the fish. After some delay we were given our meals but found we had both been given a vegetarian meal. I had to walk down to the galley to let them know and was told in a very offhand manner that they must have recorded the wrong choice - no apology. Eventually we received the fish which by then was dry and not enjoyable. We were asked for breakfast choices and gave in cards which stated we wanted a light choice 40 minutes before landing. We were not given anything. The service was really poor - and as usual the business seats were falling behind the quality and comfort found in other airlines. BA will really have to improve their product to continue to attract premium passengers.,Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Newark to London Heathrow,01/06/2018,no,Verified,4,3,1,1,4,2,3
"worlds away from what it used to be""
",1 reviews,22/06/2018,United Kingdom," We can not fault the new 'Club World' food and service, on the 747 outbound and 777 inbound it was great! The food was first class, the presentation very attractive, the quality very high - haven't had such tender beef on any airline before (or in a restaurant for that matter lately!) and the new style crockery/glass wear stylishly upmarket. It's worlds away from what it used to be, both crews were attentive, friendly and cheerful. Really liked the way the food came out on a trolley and you could pick and choose what you liked and mix and match if you wanted to. You now get a light day blanket, a padded blanket for night and a mattress protector type thing to put on the base of your seat, much better than the thin always static blanket you used to get. The pillow is larger and tons better than before. Can't believe how fast the time flew and how well we felt on landing both in Seattle and once home again. We do mainly Club Europe flights, shame as if this level of service and food is maintained the new Club World will be a great success.",Boeing 747 and Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to Seattle,01/06/2018,yes,Verified,1,4,5,5,5,3,4

unexpected problem with the systems,Robert Dixon-Gough,20/06/2018,United Kingdom,"  Calgary to London. Cabin full. Overhead locker full of blankets. Seat excruciatingly uncomfortable and headphone that worked intermittently. Take off about 1945 local time. Evening meal appeared at about 2030 local time. Menu listed seasonal salad (leaf, one small piece of lettuce and cucumber), braised short rib of beef or mushroom ravioli pasta, with butter pecan cake. Only 3 beef meals available. Choice was either pasta or to go hungry. I chose the latter and dined on a small bottle of water and half a cup of tomato juice. Breakfast (a light refreshment including juice, tea and coffee) consisted of a cream cheese roll, and oat biscuit, and half a cup of warm tea some 30 minutes later. We paid extra for World Traveller Plus but I consider that we were conned. Customer services have been useless and on the second time of writing I received the following response, ""Thanks for coming back to us. I completely understand why you’re disappointed we couldn’t offer you our full catering service, especially as on such a long haul flight. I hope our staff explained our catering supplier had an unexpected problem with the systems they use to deliver their catering.

charge a large amount for choosing seats,2 reviews,20/06/2018,United Kingdom,"  Glasgow to New York JFK via London. Outgoing flight was on a refurbished 747. Still I could see its age. We had a duo seat at the back of the plane. The plane was hot and there are no air con vents above your head. The IFE was decent and had a good selection. The cabin crew member looking after us was pleasant and friendly and he chatted to us. Flight left close to on time. Service was quick as we were first served at the back. We were given pretzels and drinks first then dinner was about an hour later, which was vegetarian pasta for me. Adequate amount of food served and was tasty. Ice cream and juice/water was served halfway through the flight. We then received a snack before landing which was a sandwich and a toblerone. It was ok. Return flight from Vegas was on a old 747. Horrible old seats with no padding and very dirty. Service was a lot slower as they announced they had less staff. Less drinks served, again food was ok chicken curry this time. Small snack of a egg tortilla yoghurt and muffin served for breakfast. IFE was horrendous on the old 747 tiny grainy screen with a very limited choice. I wouldnt fly BA again if I had a choice because they charge such a large amount for choosing the duo seats. £210 return it cost us and it made the air fare expensive.

aircraft lacked the legroom,P Ritter,20/06/2018,United Kingdom,"  Flew on a last minute emergency trip London Heathrow to Baltimore with BA. Most disappointing feature on this roundtrip was the aircraft the new Boeing 787. I found the aircraft too small and cramped for transatlantic routes, in its 3-3-3 seating configuration, despite the crews in flight service and the inflight entertainment being of a generally average economy standard, the aircraft lacked the legroom and seating comfort of the other aircraft I have flown on other transatlantic routes, 777, 767, A340 and 747. BA needs to remove many seats from this aircraft in economy class, also the cabin air temperature was awful and humid, with no individual regulation.

an additional €476 for seat selection,G Leane,19/06/2018,Ireland,"  Earlier this year, my wife and I travelled business class with BA from Dublin to Jo'burg, returning from Cape Town, thru London in each direction. Having paid business class fares, we were then quite taken aback to have to pay an additional €476 for seat selection on the long haul sectors. Had we not selected seats, we could have found ourselves not just separated, but possibly with one of us on the upper deck and one on the lower deck of the A380 on the way out and the 747 on the return flight. We therefore had no choice. What sort of customer retention policy is this? No other airline with whom we have travelled business class has then charged for seat selection, but BA just don't seem to care. It is a rip-off. The forward/rear facing business class seat plan on BA planes is really unattractive, complicated further by having to climb over a sleeping passenger to reach the aisle from a window seat. BA should take a look at the Emirates A380 if they want to see a customer friendly layout. This was our first business class experience with BA.

FAs went through the motions,31 reviews,12/06/2018,United Kingdom," 
BA’s Galleries lounge at CPT is adequate but let down by a poor food selection (including packaged cheese and biscuits, with flimsy wooden knives) and limited wine choices. Champagne was conspicuously lacking. Toilet paper wasn’t being refreshed in the toilets and here was no lock on one of the cubicle doors. There were no information screens, so one had to wait for the tannoy call to board. Boarding itself was efficient, with priority for groups 1 and 2. Seats 62J/K on the upper deck are the best of a mediocre job, and at least there's plenty of storage space in the window bins. Take off was on schedule. FAs went through the motions, with little enthusiasm. The food was the worst we've ever experienced in Club World. The 'smoked chicken salad' was atrocious and the 'scrambled eggs with chives in a tortilla wrap' deserves to be in a museum of culinary horrors. The White Company bedding was a let-down and far removed from the luxury portrayed in adverts. There's little one can do to remedy a hard seat. Landing was ahead of schedule. Overall, a lacklustre flight in an ancient plane with a sub-par business class product.

there was little to dislike,Mike Palmer,09/06/2018,Canada," I took the new option of the new Toronto to London Gatwick which debuted this summer as a seasonal route. Cheaper than the Heathrow service, it was an interesting experiment in whether I could fall back in love with Gatwick. Excellent check in at Pearson as usual, but spoiled by the third party lounge. Goodness knows what BA were thinking, given the old lounge was well run with excellent drinks and food options. The Premium Plaza lounge is cheap and nasty. On time boarding on a near empty flight (too early in the season for the return traffic to have built up). The cabin was a third full. Juice and water offered. No Prosecco in Premium Economy though the crew member couldn't explain why it's not offered to London, but why Champagne in Biz is manageable. On time departure, and a fast drinks service. This is my first experience of Gatwick crew. Fast, sociable, less formal and streets ahead of mixed fleet crew serving Heathrow. (and all over 25!) The meal was vile - overcooked, salty and dry. As the plane was empty, I went back to economy and had three hours sleep across three seats. Awful breakfast of pretzel roll and cream cheese was served before landing. IFE on both legs was dated and still the same selection since my flights at Christmas! An early arrival and fast bags finished off a ok flight. Returning, I liked the biz / first class check in area at LGW - fast and friendly. The lounge at Gatwick was streets ahead of Heathrow. Self serve Champagne and loads of seats. Kept very clean and plenty of food. An upgrade to biz was nice on a full flight. Efficient boarding and a fast coat / drink and menu service. A really fast bar service only 20 mins in, with well cooked food made the service just like the old days of long haul cabin crew from Heathrow. The only thing that spoilt it was off duty BA staff in Biz, chatting (and distracting) the crew on duty while drinking in the aisle and generally being loud and annoying. An early arrival into Toronto finished a near perfect flight, The Gatwick 777s are old - very old with no power in Premium Economy.

very pleasantly surprised,D Kemble,07/06/2018,United Kingdom,  This is the first time I have flown BA's Club Europe flying from London Heathrow to Corfu. I was not expecting a great deal having read a lot of less than positive reviews online however I was very pleasantly surprised. Shortly after boarding we were offered a welcome drink with a bag of nuts and a choice of magazine to read. Not long after this there was a full drinks service followed but a 4 course meal which was very tasty. I had cured salon followed by chicken breast then ginger cheesecake and a small cheese plate. We were then offered a choice of hot drinks and a top up of champagne. The crew were very attentive and helpful. They had a smile on their face all the time and the flight seemed to zip past. The seats were the usual economy seats with the middle blanked by a tray but for a relatively short trip it was fine. This flight was an upgrade using Avios and I would happily do it again. I paid around 6500 avios and an extra £13 in taxes which I think was very good value for what I had.,A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to Corfu ,01/05/2018,yes,Verified,9,4,5,5,4,5,-1
budget airlines can do better,Leslie Mardell,06/06/2018,United Kingdom,"  Our original flight was cancelled as my wife and I were just disembarking from a cruise ship. We were then advised shortly after by SMS that we had been automatically re-booked on a flight the next day, to London Heathrow. This was not a lot of good when our car was parked at Gatwick. I managed to get through to BA and was given a new booking to Gatwick also the following day. We were offered no other assistance by the airline. The following day we turned up at the airport to find the new flight was running 40 minutes late. Having eventually boarded the aircraft, we stayed at the gate for about 45 minutes before the captain deigned to tell us that the delay was being caused by problems at Barcelona airport. Shortly thereafter the captain advised us that we might wait for another two hours, so we would be given water. This was quickly superseded by a further announcement that a slot had become available at short notice, so no water was served. The real horror of this flight, however, was British Airways new food service, whereby passengers buy food and pay by card/Avios. This simply does not work. After one hour in the air, the trolley had moved about nine rows from the front of the cabin. Eventually a flight attendant attempted to work from the back forward by running backwards and forwards from the trolley. About 20 minutes from touchdown he reached us and we asked for two cans of drink and a packet of crisps (potato chips). He returned to tell us he had no crisps and only one can, which we duly shared between us. Having been on the aircraft for three and a half hours, this was the only refreshment we could obtain. I consider this to be completely unacceptable. If this is the level of service we can now expect from British Airways, there is no point traveling with them.

above-and-beyond service,4 reviews,05/06/2018,United States,"  Washington to Bucharest return via London. I was originally booked in World Traveller Plus but at Dulles check-in was offered a Club World upgrade at just $499 more which I accepted - resulting flight was very comfortable with good food and top-drawer service. The two London-Bucharest sectors both went well. But all this was just a prelude to my return trip. While in Bucharest I sustained a fall and although I wasn't seriously hurt it was still difficult to walk long distances especially with heavy luggage. At the Bucharest airport bag drop the agent noticed my situation and offered assistance, which I accepted - and was promptly wheeled through security, passport control and the (very long) corridors to the gate, then put aboard the plane. On arrival in London I was met by more assistance to whisk me through the vastness of T5 and onto the plane, this time with the pleasant surprise of another Club World upgrade (this time for free). Once on the plane back to Washington the cabin crew couldn't do enough for me, checking how I was doing, going through meal choices (the menu this time round was a bit heavy on cheese and other dairy items I really can't eat but ultimately I still ate well), getting me drinks, and more. They were as professional and proactive a crew as I've ever experienced in 40 years of long-haul travel. Finally, once arrived at Dulles more assistance was waiting, right up to getting my cab. What could have been an ordeal on this return trip was turned into as relaxing and satisfying a travel experience as can be imagined - through the years I've had mostly excellent experiences with BA cabin crews and that's a big reason why I've stayed with BA all these years and will continue to do so.

Due to poor weather conditions at LHR, the flight was initially delayed by 2 hours which is quite understandable. When the passengers were informed of the gate, everyone gathered at the 'A' gate in T5. Then, no announcement and the ground staff were in a world of their own. Next, there is a screen notice that the flight will depart from a C gate. Everyone rushes to the one of the last of the 'C' gates. Once on board, the dreaded announcement that the flight will be delayed by another hour. The flight finally takes off nearly three hours late. After a while, the crew comes with the M&S gibberish but passengers are so hungry that by the time the crew serve the fifth row in economy the sandwiches are all over and I had packet of crisps and a diet coke for dinner.

a hit-or-miss affair,David Ellis,02/06/2018,United Kingdom,"  London to Cape Town. Flying first class with British Airways is a hit-or-miss affair. But having secured a couple of return flights to Cape Town with Avios, our expectations were running high as we entrusted our car to the meet and greet parking. Unfortunately, Terminal 3 isn't the best starting point and Galleries First lacks glamour - or decent champagnes. The food on offer is adequate, although hardly first class. Hoping for better on board, we didn't use the sit down menu. Boarding was on time and according to BA's new group allocation. Our seats - 2K and 3K - were a first for us, as we've previously gone for pairs in the centre. But seats A and K are definitely superior, with more storage space and better privacy. However, there's no escaping the fact that the relatively recent first class refit is in a relatively ancient plane, particularly when one inspects the shabby state of fittings in the toilets and galley. The IFE is also showing its age and badly in need of an upgrade. But at least it didn't require rebooting on our flight. Cabin crew in first were the usual mixed bag. The FA looking after our side seemed to be in the wrong job. Food was better than usual, although a malfunctioning oven meant that we had to wait 30 minutes for our hot breakfast. Landing was ahead of schedule and we were through immigration and baggage reclaim within 15 minutes.

Avios program is nearly worthless,J Keapher,02/06/2018,United States,"  London to Hamburg. Typically if I fly BA it is SFO or LAX to LHR. This time I flew them from Miami via Tampa thru LHR to Hamburg. Using their Avios points I secured a first class seat which of course is a scam because BA charges you fees and surcharges to use those points at $500 per direction. Their Miami operation appears to be a poor second class cousin to American as they use two of their ticketing and check in kiosks plus share the American premium class (not) lounge. All the american processed slices of cheese and bologna you can eat with free booze is not what I call a premium lounge. The BA gate in the dreadful E terminal is not even on the main floor but downstairs. People jammed up to the entry points for boarding which creates a mess of boarding people by sections. Boarding was like a cattle call. BA flies one of its oldest B747 into Miami and it showed even in first. The seats were of the older design and it appeared the carpet was recent but the cabin smelled of moldy carpet. The service and food was surprisingly good compared to their service out of California. The flight was late leaving and late arriving, and this Miami flight does not dock in terminal 5. Rather terminal 3 and requiring its passengers to take shuttle buses to the other terminals which is what I did for my connection to Hamburg. In the end I decided I was done with BA because their service model for premium passengers has  hit rock bottom. Their Avios program is nearly worthless on any premium class booking or on its partner airlines. Try using BA points on American or Cathay or even Alaska and you will find it impossible regardless how far in advance you try.",Boeing 747,Solo Leisure,First Class,Miami to Hamburg via London,01/05/2018,no,Verified,1,3,4,3,2,1,-1

they understand my frustration,1 reviews,30/05/2018,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Mahon. Booked 9 months ago flights for first family holiday for 2 years for 2 adults, 2 children and 1 infant in lap (almost £1k for all of us. Pre-booked seats at the same time. I was rather surprised when I got an email two weeks out saying “about your flight to Madrid on the 26th May” when I was flying direct Heathrow to Menorca. Airline assured me everything was fine. Further concern when self-service check-in opened 24 hours out, wife and daughters checked in fine, me and my son were referred to airport check-in (despite all being on the same booking). An urgent call to BA I was told 1) I was probably being moved to a bassinet position. When I pointed out this was utter nonsense she reneged and said 2) infants can’t check in online which I now understand is also incorrect. My concern was well placed. At BA T5 bag drop, check in agent looked flustered, a note in the booking prompted her to call various people and after about ten minutes she handed me a bunch of boarding passes. Only after I checked them she sheepishly admitted that our pre-booked seats were gone, my son and I had no seats at all and were standby, and my wife and daughters were dotted all around the cabin (16 rows apart). ‘Prebooked seating is not guaranteed you know!’ After kicking up a huge fuss (I believe they can’t legally sit children below a certain age away from parents?) the check-in manager offered me no explanation other than full flights, but promised me it would be sorted once they got round to closing my flight. Fast forward to the gate – utter carnage including the check-in supervisor (who cant have been more than 22) in tears. When I eventually got seen I was finally given a seat number for me and my son, again many rows apart from the rest of my family. As this was my sons first ever flight, I was absolutely livid that we couldn’t sit anywhere near each other. Added to that, my son is breastfed so how we are going to manage feeding, kids needing toilet etc. I put my foot down and was eventually given a single middle seat two rows again from my daughters who were by now sat together thank goodness. We boarded the flight pretty much last after all the furore & holding my son I get to my assigned seat and someone is in it. Asking to see his boarding pass surprise surprise he is in the correct seat. Cue BA staff running around and frantically checking boarding passes. Such is the confidence that the cabin crew have in their own ground staff, I even heard one of them mutter ‘check boarding cards and flight numbers as someone around here is on the wrong flight’! Fast forward another 5 mins and the plane is now pushing back with me standing in an aisle holding my son with not an empty seat on the plane with me saying to my wife that we’re going to have to get off here and my children in tears. Much checking of iPads and a BA staff member is then found (there were quite a few on the flight apparently) and hurriedly moved to the jumpseat whilst an announcement from the flight deck is booming out for everyone to take their seats or delay the flight (what seat?). Raised a formal complaint and was told that they 'understand my frustration' which is nice. Separate complaint raised to CAA about a pushing back with passengers including an infant with no seat.

this experience was a disgrace,1 reviews,27/05/2018,United Kingdom,"  Outbound from LHR to Washington on a refurbished 747 400 was in Economy all in all wasn't a bad experience, modern looking cabin with excellent IFE system, food and wine was good and cabin crew very attentive, was looking forward to the return trip as had upgraded to Premium Economy. Return flight BA 292 was delayed by late arrival of inbound flight, but no worries could relax in the PE cabin, boarding the aircraft and turning left for the first time ever immediate disappointed, how old was the plane? The cabin was dull and those seats looked as though they had seen better days, a quick check and this particular 747 was delivered to 1998 and hadn't had the refurbishment treatment. Leg room was a tad better than economy but seat controls not very efficient and as for the IFE system that decided not to work, mind you the screen was so small and scratched I doubt I would have been able to watch anything. Cabin crew offered a pre take off drink water or orange juice and a hot towel that had seen better days, it was the sort of thing that you clean your car with, after a few words from the Captain we departed. The evening meal was some sort of chicken with rice with real cutlery and was ok, wine and G&T was acceptable, about 1 hour before landing breakfast was served or should I say offered some sort of filled roll. I declined and had a tea in a paper cup and nothing more offered. I should add that the cabin crew were very attentive and tried to make us feel a bit special, for having spent an extra £400 for the upgrade.

IFE is a work of mystery,26 reviews,26/05/2018,Australia," Singapore to London. This was the second part of my Sydney to London trip and looked forward to it as it was on a BA A380. Now this aircraft, in Qantas colours, is one I am very familiar with having flown around 30 sectors over the last 12 months with QF. As mentioned in my review of BA16 (which was the first leg of this trip) it is the on board soft product that is the problem. The same comments for that review apply here. The IFE is a work of mystery in terms of content. On Qantas, American, Cathay one gets a really good mix of old and new movies, great music choices. Those who compile the content need to look at what they mean by award winning (Godfather, Gladiator, Brave-heart, Roman Holiday etc) are all things we as passengers want to see. Some smart edgy team in Soho, London pulled the content together forgetting that not everyone is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuff. IFE is one thing on long haul. The other is food and beverage. The food quality was just substandard and something I read about constantly. On Qantas (say QF1 from Singapore to London) one gets the evening meal service, followed by Weiss ice cream, a Lindt chocolate along the way, midnight snack of a pizza or sandwich and morning breakfast (fruit or eggs with usual muffin etc. At the rear of the main deck is a snack bar and in the galley will be found, chocolates, banana bread, cheese and biscuits. You would need to be really hungry to get through that lot but the point is that it is available and offered. BA need to get away from a meal service on take off and landing and nothing in between. The A380 is a flagship aircraft and on Qantas it is treated as such. I am a Qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time on their planes. Put the smartest, best looking crew onto a flagship as that is what people will remember. The BA crew were of a certain vintage more suited to lawn bowls. One guy looked like Steptoe (for those who remember) and was a miserable. Flying on an A380 should be an experience and I enjoy all my trips on that aircraft. BA have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from one point to another. That is sad given the stature of BA. I came back on BA31 from London to Hong Kong and the same comments apply. Hard product is fine (except for no snack bar) but the soft product is lacking severely.",A380,Business,Economy Class,Singapore to London,01/05/2018,no,Verified,3,4,2,1,3,4,1
years have not been kind,26 reviews,25/05/2018,Australia," Sydney to London via Singapore. It has been a very long time since I was on a long haul with BA of more than 9 hours. Last year had a relative sprint from London to JFK and before that in 2002. The years have not been kind to BA. Probably a mixture of the decline of BA and the emergence of other airlines. Nearly all my long haul is with Qantas on its A380, occasionally Emirates on its version and then once in a while with Cathay Pacific and American Airlines. The problem is not the hard product. A B777 or the A380 in whatever colour and decor is ordered is the same air frame. The B777 from Sydney to Singapore was fine. Nosier than the A380 but that is well known. Very comfortable seats and at 8 hours a relative sprint for those who call Sydney home. It is the soft product that is lacking. Check in was fine and despite being in Economy had an express pass through security (being a Gold FF with Qantas). Boarding was orderly and an on time departure and arrival into Singapore. Now its just a lack of polish with the soft product. No menu given showing what was to be served (as with Cathay, Emirates and Qantas). The cutlery was really cheap and I mean cheap. KFC offers a better grade of plastic. I know in these days of security that proper silverware is not possible but someone at BA needs to check out the plastic used on Cathay and Qantas). The food itself was very bland; a salad that had seen better days and penne with some sauce that was over salty. Qantas have done away with salads and simply give you a main dish plus garlic bread and a dessert. It's just the quality that is lacking. Drinks? I have a tradition, something silly, about starting a journey off with a Jack Daniels and Coke. This is available on Qantas but no sir, we don't serve that. A note about the FA's: they were great but one gets the feeling that they are chirpy to mask some of the shortcomings with the product they are asked to deliver. Final word about this leg is the iFE. A touchscreen but it was slow in response time and the selection was diabolically bad. Award winning or classic films with not a noted film from the last 30 years. One or two interesting things and some new releases. Come on BA, for may being on a plane for that length of time is a perfect opportunity to catch up on much loved classics. As for music: well I'm 53 but still like the Pearl Jams etc of the world. We are not all into Brit Pop and edgy music presenters. If BA is serious about the airline business then it needs to sharpen up the soft skills, the food and beverage and add a touch of pizzazz about the airline. It is a mix of BA going back and many others coming up and beyond the standards that BA set many years ago.",Boeing 777-200,Business,Economy Class,Sydney to London via Singapore,01/05/2018,no,Verified,9,4,3,1,4,4,1

The departure was from Terminal 1 in Munich, which is by far not as nice as the newer terminal 2.

almost a low fare airline,J Measen,14/05/2018,United States,"  Washington to Prague via London. I have flown them several times in the past, but not for a number of years. I remember them as not a ""top of the line"" airline, but better than average. This time it seemed that any nice things have been dropped (hot towels as you neared your destination), and they have become almost a low fare airline. You pay for reserving seats, on shorter flights you pay for food, etc. The seating on the Boeing 787 seemed very cramped. It is said to be 31"" but seemed like less. On the return flight on May 3rd, two of the lavatories went out of service. The A320 from London to Prague seemed to have more seat room, but the seats were very hard. They may be the new ""slimline"" seats, I'm not sure, but they were very uncomfortable even for a two hour flight. Also, on the Washington  to LHR flight we had printed out boarding passes at home. The agent at Washington printed out additional ones and said we should use them, but when we got to security she had printed out two for me and none for my wife. It was lucky we still had the one we printed out at home. I won't say that I will not fly them again, but I will definitely compare prices in the future.

Crew was hardly more attentive to service than in coach. Food which used to be fantastic is just eatable, no more. Wines which were the best in the sky when Jancis Robinson and Hugh Johnson made the selection (apart from a good white champagne, but mediocre rosé) are at the level of a business class. And my seat did not have sound from the audio/video system: so they moved me. And an hour later the whole system stopped without the crew apologizing. Needless to say no wifi! Apart from their LHR First and Concorde Room lounges at LHR which remain great, BA is now no better than a 3 star airline.

legroom was insufficient,8 reviews,11/05/2018,Netherlands,"  Tokyo to Amsterdam via London. On the evening before departure I received an email from BA the flight would be delayed for one hour but we were urged to get to the airport on the original time in case there wouldn't be a delay. In the end the aircraft left Tokyo Haneda with a 90 minutes delay. Baggage drop off was smooth and was handled with Japanese politeness. If you have the choice to fly from NRT or HND I would definitely choose HND because it's much more conveniently located to downtown Tokyo. The aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were bussed to the aircraft, adding more time to the delay we already had. I didn't like the seats on the 777. I found them quite uncomfortable and the legroom was insufficient, especially when you have an instant recline type passenger in front of you. On the window and aisle seats, there's also the IFE box so there's no place for both feet. The meal was a joke and there was no choise. Inflight entertainment is not up to date, small screens with low brightness. The crew was not very friendly. When I went to the galley for a drink I was was urged to return to my seat instead of drinking in the galley and stretching my legs. The second meal service was rushed. We've got our meals and after 5 minutes the crew returned to pick up the trays because we were already descending to LHR.  Luckily I've made it to my connecting flight to Amsterdam because I had a short connection. The A320 flight to Amsterdam departed ahead of schedule. There's nothing special to write about this short flight although one round of drinks would have been nice.

service was quite prompt,A Palomo,11/05/2018,United Kingdom, Check-in at Vienna Airport was painless. BA uses Air Lounge at Vienna and was adequate with enough seating and food was okay. Boarding was a scrum as there was no priority given to Club Europe passengers. The flight wasn’t full therefore service was quite prompt. I found the crew to be quite engaging and friendly and were happy to talk to. The food was quite mediocre which consisted of afternoon tea scones and miniscule sandwiches. One passenger wasn’t very happy with the serving and the crew tried her hardest to explain what afternoon tea was. Business class was quite average to be honest.

pathetic cost cutting antics,K Healy,11/05/2018,United Kingdom," Took a day trip to Vienna with British Airways, booked at the last minute. Flying out at 0720 on a Sunday and having an early start to get to the airport I was looking forward to getting some sleep on the flight. Having never usually been a problem, I boarded the aircraft and asked if it would be possible to get a pillow and blanket, to be told by a member of crew that these are not for economy passengers – only business. Freezing temperature onboard the aircraft, so managed to get limited sleep – another example of BA’s pathetic cost cutting antics and demonstrates the non-existence of customer service within the airline. Despite it being one of the first flights out of Heathrow, with no queue for departure and perfect weather conditions – we still managed to arrive about 20 minutes late into Vienna – quite as to how, is beyond me.

I was pleasantly surprised,T Razim,08/05/2018,United Kingdom,"  Chicago to London Heathrow. I was dubious about flying BA especially after my last flight over a year ago - after which I left the aircraft feeling very hungry. However my trip to USA with BA was surprisingly very good both ways. On this flight, after deciding not to spend on an upgrade, I was pleasantly surprised by being given a seat with extra leg room - didn't feel the need to get up and stretch my legs once. Although I slept a lot of the way, the cabin crew were very helpful - even asking the captain to find the direction of Mecca so I could pray (in my seat). Was given two bags of pretzels and two cups of coffee - i had to ask for both, but was given without any fuss. A380 is a very nice aircraft and the take off and landing was excellent, although I noticed a funny (not that loud) motorised noise coming form the galley noise of the journey. For dinner there was butter chicken, rice and lentils, and a rice pudding type desert, all of which was okay - nothing special.",A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to London Heathrow,01/05/2018,yes,Verified,10,4,4,3,4,3,3

This was an interesting comparison as we had flown out to HK on an A350 on Cathay Pacific and the difference was huge. The BA Club World cabin is very cramped when compared with Cathay. The seat configuration is ok if you want to chat to your wife or friend but there is very little room to store items and just feels very cramped. The duvets and blankets come in a bag that is in the seat area, which the crew insist on putting in the overhead lockers for take off, this is fare enough but there is little room. They also provide bottle of water, which is great, but again little storage area. The food service was also disappointing, the duck breast as my main course was very tough. Drinks selection was very good. Plus points go to the cabin crew, who were very professional and had a sense of humour.

experience was totally acceptable,B Stuart,03/05/2018,United States,"  Los Angeles to London Heathrow return.  Outbound First Class, return Club World. A380 both sectors, awesome aircraft. Firstly, BA flight deck crews are awesome. Totally professional and you know that they are tremendous pilots.  The cabin crew on both sectors were polite, friendly and professional. Their service was excellent. I wasn’t feeling well on the out bound flight and I didn’t eat anything, so I can’t comment on the food. On the return flight, in Club World, the food was very good, no complaints there. The seats were comfortable although the Club World cabin felt cramped. I was in 53K which is a window rear facing bulk head seat. As it was a daytime flight, the noise coming from the galley didn’t bother me, but I think it would be an issue on night flights. I hope BA change their business class seating for something like AA business class on their 777-300s. BA business class is really dated, and I said it felt cramped. My BIG issue, and this isn’t entirely BA’s fault was the over zealous security screening at Heathrow. I was pulled aside for screening 3 times. I don’t mind extensive, in depth security but to be screened 3 times was excessive. I am enrolled in and pay for TSA Pre Check and if British Airways would participate in this program, it would save a lot of angst.

this change is not acceptable,Vera Broussova,17/04/2018,United Kingdom,"  London to Moscow. British Airways has downgraded their plane to a smaller plane and hence seat in Business class is no longer Club World (flat bed) seat but Club Europe seat (not flat bed). It is a night flight and this change is important and not acceptable. I cannot fly during the day as I have meetings scheduled. BA has not offered a like for like change, they offered seats on an early flight next morning which is not suitable as this flight is during the day. Moreover the fare that we paid for the night flight was more expensive that those that BA is offering during the day. They also not allowing me to cancel the flight and rebook another or change the outbound flight to another date, like Friday when the seat (whether club world or club Europe) is less important as Saturday not a working day and one can get a rest. In Summary it is unacceptable that BA is charging more for the flights with Club World Seat and then swapping it to smaller plane without offering a like for like change.

recent BA experience was positive,P Steiger,16/04/2018,United Kingdom,"  Miami to London. My most recent BA experience was positive. I fly BA for work and leisure up to 4 long haul flights a year. On my most recent flight from Miami to LHR I found the whole economy experience well above average, despite the dated aircraft the 747-400. Which to me is the legend of the skies! The cabin crew in economy were smart, attentive and seemed to go beyond the call of duty giving an elite service, from the MIA ground handling American crew. Food and beverage service was good, seating in my aisle seat 29E generous for my long legs. I recently flew BA business/ Club world to the Far East for work and despite the unlimited catering and frills the cabin staff lacked the attention and friendliness of this flight. Well done BA you excel against the North American carriers on routes to the North American gateways who give just a basic service.",Boeing 747-400,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to London ,01/03/2018,yes,Verified,10,4,4,4,4,4,4
among the most greedy airlines,J Chekasul,15/04/2018,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Dallas. The aircraft was old no sign of refurbishment for the last 10 years or so. Seat pocket was full of rubbish from previous flight. The personal screen is tiny and no longer responsive as a touch screen, so I had to use the remote control which is fixed on the armrest and non retractable. The choice of IFE is very limited. The food on both outbound and inbound flights were mediocre and with small portion. I saw some passengers request for more food, and I was glad to see the crew giving out nicely without attitude. I must admit that the crew on the outbound were exceptional, whilst the inbound were acceptable but still better than most crew on flights to/from JFK. I had an onward connecting flight with American Airlines, and I can clearly see the changes between the 2 airlines over the past few years. Whilst AA is improving, BA is becoming a national embarrassment. BA remains among the most greedy airlines when it comes to seat selection. The seat selection price tag just makes the total cost higher than other decent airlines. It no longer deserves a 4-star rating, but edging between 2 or 3 star. It's not even worth redeeming Avios points anymore.

the seat pitch is ridiculous,J Aberg,14/04/2018,Sweden," Decided to go in Club Europe for this relatively short flight (90 minutes) from London to Copenhagen. Dropped my bags and went through security, which did not take too long. I then went to the Galleries Lounge (south), and although I have not been there for a year or two, it looked the same. Same food, same drinks, same slow wifi. My gate was just around the corner, and I got on the plane. I like the fresh look inside, but the seat pitch is ridiculous in business. The food service was disappointing. The service in the cabin was OK, but not very warm.

"Unprofessional staff, uncomfortable seats",B Seares,13/04/2018,United Kingdom," Premium economy worse than most airlines economy. Unprofessional staff, uncomfortable seats, foot rest but no leg rest, very little seat recline and difficult to operate. Rubbish food, very poor landing and everything went flying. Additionally, we were a family of 4 travelling together but split up and 3 of us were seated between two of the four toilets that serve 160 people. These “premium economy” seats are directly outside the toilet doors which meant an entire night kept awake with the noise and light from the loos. Other airlines have toilet lights that dim until you lock the door to avoid flooding the cabin with light - not BA. Even the staff kept leaving the toilet doors open after they went in to blow their nose or check their teeth or makeup. This was the second leg on a flight from Sydney (via LAX) so we were beyond tired. When an attendant picked up my son’s water at the end of the very long and sleepless flight, he didn’t hear my son say “thanks” (which he had) so the attendant said pointedly “You’re welcome - rude!” and laughed about it with the passenger next to him. In my experience, better (and cheaper) premium economy can be found with Norwegian, Air New Zealand and American Airlines - all of whom also allow seat selection without additional charge. I’ve never had cause for complaint with any of those airlines but with British Airways, I’ve never had a good experience.",A380,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Los Angeles to London,01/04/2018,no,Verified,10,1,1,2,1,1,3
Not value for money,C Norton,12/04/2018,United Kingdom," I have been flying with BA for the last 32 years between Sao Paulo and London on and off but mostly BA. I have travelled in all classes except First. BA used to be a very good airline and stand out from most but now they look like a low cost airline with high cost fares. Not value for money. The food and drinks are parsimonious to the extend of me having to ask for a drink, even in Business (I flew out Club and returned Economy plus). Staff on board are still the usual arrogant and discretely rude, no changes there. Boarding has become indifferent and they group classes in 5 different queues of travel so we have become just a number. Service is not exclusive anymore. Seats on the 777-300 wear hard and uncomfortable including the beds on CLub. Their lounge performance is very poor also with food option variety (in case of food allergies/intolerances) really bad and of poor quality. It is a shame Singapore Airlines doesn't fly to Brazil from the UK as they definitely offer top quality service especially on their business class. BA has become mean, greedy and indifferent to their customers and I feel it is time for the CEO to go as he is ruining the image of the airline. The changes on baggage weight has become silly also. I was allowed two luggages of 23kg. Any sensible person would allow me to pass with one luggage at 27kg and one of 10kg as I haven't go above the allowance I am entitled. Instead I had to reshuffle my contents from the big luggage to the small luggage to make it 23 and 14. In my opinion unnecessary as I had 37 kgs in total and not 47kg! So I will in future re-think my trips to Brazil. Even if I have to make my journey longer as I am after good service, value for money and a differentiated experience.

the worst flight I have ever had,B Palmer,10/04/2018,United Kingdom," Flew British Airways from Budapest to London Heathrow. Quite possibly the worst flight I have ever had (and I travel often). Generally when we travel, we try to pack our hand baggage light, as we check our heavier bags and it's more convenient for other passengers too. My partner and I had 2 briefcase-sized bags between us that fit nicely in the overhead locker. As more passengers boarded, most with as-large-as-possible carryons, the overhead lockers filled up. The flight attendant walks up to the overhead locker above our heads, takes out our bags, hands them to us and says ""I'm sorry but the space is needed for large bags"", telling us to put them underneath the seat in front of us. Reducing our leg room to zero. How is this at all fair? I questioned why we should lose our leg room as a result of having smaller carry-ons, and was given the response that I would delay the flight if the bags had to be offloaded. I have no idea who at BA thought it would be a good policy to hand out the yellow tags that mean ""thank you for bringing smaller carry-ons than everyone else, as a measure of our appreciation, we'll take away your leg room"". The general decorum of the flight attendants also deserves a mention. Young adults barely out of high school, and who would be more suited to making coffees in a road services Starbucks, such was their experience at providing pleasant service. What a sad state of affairs. I will never ever travel British Airways willingly again, long haul or short haul. I would rather take a civilised one-stop journey with Lufthansa and arrive in a pleasant frame of mind than endure the persistent dirty feeling of a direct British Airways flight.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Budapest to London Heathrow,01/03/2018,no,Verified,1,1,1,-1,3,2,-1
service was outstanding,D Kemp,08/04/2018,United States," The air conditioning didn’t work in the part of the airplane where we were sitting and it was very hot. I had to stand in the back of the airplane where it was cooler. It was an 8 hours flight from London Heathrow to New York JFK. Overall the airplane was old with little space to seat. There was no wi-fi. The leg/seating space was very small. I wish that food would be more taste neutral. If your child doesn’t like spicy or flavored foods/snacks, there would be nothing to eat. The stewardesses were most helpful and their service was outstanding. Landing was smooth. The BA staff made us to check in our bags even they were carry on. There are measuring boxes where you should be able to stick your luggage in, and these boxes are very small. Also the Airport Security was overly zealous - they had to search kids bag, and they found roll-on deodorant and checked it for fumes.",Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to New York JFK,01/04/2018,no,Verified,3,1,5,2,1,3,2

Well presented aircraft, staff in premium economy cabin offered welcome drink. Slightly delayed departure time made up en route. Unable to order main course for meal on line but got choice of meal which was totally acceptable. Efficient staff and good inflight entertainment. Happy with whole experience.

As this was a night flight we decided to fly business so we might get some sleep and I now wish we'd saved the extra that it cost, a complete waste of money. The cabin is very dated, and cramped, it wasn't clean (half a biscuit down the side of my seat and plastic bags on the floor) and the service and food were average at best. Why in this day and age do BA persist with having seats with no direct aisle access? Not that I could get comfortable enough to sleep anyway, the seat was adequate and no more, the entertainment system screen was small and the touch screen was very clunky, needing very firm contact to get any response. On top of this there was no USB point to charge my phone! I expected better cabin service than we got, not offered tea or coffee after dinner and it seemed to be a case of asking for anything that was needed rather than being offered it - I certainly don't expect to have to remind the flight attendant about the cup of tea requested 15 minutes earlier.

An efficient courtesy bus took us from car rentals (terminal 1) to the international terminal (terminal 4). Check-in was friendly. Security staff insisted on using a whole-body scanner for everyone and were overly officious. Surprisingly, there was no business class lounge, although there was plenty of sitting space before the gates in the redeveloped terminal. Boarding was according to group rather than priority which caused some annoyance. Club World was in two smaller cabins, with the usual, outdated eight seats abreast. Take-off was on time. The wrong menus had been loaded, so the actual menu was announced over the tannoy. Drinks and food service served efficiently. Food adequate and not overcooked, but below the standard of Turkish Airlines. Seats hard and uncomfortable for sleeping, with the usual issue of having to climb over legs if in a window seat. Abbreviated breakfast (no hot option) served an hour before landing. Arrived 30 mins ahead of schedule.

additional payment to select seats,14 reviews,03/04/2018,United Arab Emirates,"  Dubai to London Heathrow. It's bad that BA requests additional payment to select seats before the check-in. If flying solo it's not a big issue, but with any companion (in this case I was with my son of 10) it would have been an issue to be separate. This also means that if there are 3 or 4 flights, and a group of two (as in my case) the difference would be substantial, up to approx 1000$. Lucky enough at least on the return flight we were able to select the middle seats because the flight wasn't full. On board service was decent. Professional, courteous and friendly attendants. Toilets in the second half of the flight weren't too clean. Flat seats in business class are outdated but comfortable for a nice sleep.

crew very friendly and professional,F Hamzil,01/04/2018,United Kingdom,"  London to Muscat first class. First time trying out first class on BA. Check-in was fairly quick and efficient, didn't have much luggage, but the first wing did not feel very exclusive. I had selected window seat in advance and this was confirmed and still intact as I got printed boarding pass. Concorde room was nice, well designed but quite crowded in some places. Had to ask for a champagne two times out in the terrace, before it got served a good 20 minutes later. Checkout out the cabana for an hour, which was not very appealing at all, and managed to miss the first 5 min of the 15min treatment I booked for the Spa. Onboard was informed there was a problem with the Seat I had selected, and was issued a new aisle seat, which was disappointing. Upon entering the first class cabin, I had a quick look at the seat, and it was not immediately apparent, there was something wrong. I asked a crew to check and they came back to confirm that I will indeed not be able to sit there, but there was no explanation of what was wrong given. I did not want to waste any time to settle in, the crew looking after me introduced himself and served me champagne and warm nuts as well as offering some magazines to read. Seat was comfortable and spacious enough and seemed fairly private, with a small wardrobe to hang jacket. The TV screen seemed quite large and high quality. Unfortunately the seat controls were not super responsive, and neither was the remote for the TV. Soon after take off, I was informed I could eat when I like. Arabic starter was great. Had pre-selected main meal online. Meal was of good quality and cooked well. Had a dessert and the mixed cheese plate (not as good as other cheese I've had in some Business class). Surprisingly the entertainment system had a rather limited selection, I imagine on two ultra-long flights in the same month, one might run out of anything of interest to watch. After finishing the one film I decided to watch, I decided to try get some sleep. Crew made the bedding while I tried to put on the pyjamas in the tiny first class bathroom. Bedding was of good quality and comfortable enough. I missed breakfast, as I was still rather full from the dinner and pre-dinner at the lounge. Overall, I was reasonably happy with the flight and the product. The crew were very friendly and professional. Given this was first class, have to admit there was no wow factor, either with the soft product or ground experience. I managed to book flights for a good price during a promo, otherwise it would personally not be worth the price tag for a fairly short flight.",Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,First Class,London to Muscat,01/03/2018,yes,Verified,5,5,4,4,4,4,3

an entirely reasonable flight,David Ellis,24/03/2018,United Kingdom," London Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale is one of BA's new long-haul routes and clearly designed to cater for winter sun seekers. From September 2018, the Gatwick fleet will be 'densified', with an horrific ten across in economy and a reduced Club World. The 777-200 on our flight was of the bog-standard 90s vintage, which meant 48 pax squeezed into the Club World cabin and everyone having to make do with the ancient, small screen, low resolution IFE that required the usual rebooting. But there were positive aspects to the flight: a young and efficient cabin crew, the improved Club World food service with plates brought individually to one's seat, and arrival ahead of schedule, although this was let down by the delayed disembarkation that's commonplace at Fort Lauderdale terminal 4.

The Boeing 777 I flew on was very dated and had power outlets for charging phones & portable devices.

Upon arrival at terminal 3 for check in I was disappointed to see no separate check in. just a young girl with a couldn't care less attitude behind a temporary room divider. Off we went to the lounge and this was atrocious, uninterested staff on the door, huge dirty plastic floral arrangement on entry that should have been binned a long time ago. The lounge looked like council offices hugely disappointing and the food offerings were not good. On board was no better a scrum at the boarding gate so not called first - was followed by a filthy seat, a screen that wouldn't stay up and a meal service that even the very nice onboard staff apologised for as she put it in front of me. Our return in Club from New Orleans was not much better, no separate check in no lounge but a $30 voucher to use in the one bar that is still open at this time of day again a filthy seat and a broken arm rest.

I end up with mix feelings,6 reviews,23/02/2018,Mexico," I have traveled several times with British Airways, but only in long haul trips. Those have been pretty good. This time I had to fly from Edinburgh to London Gatwick and I end up with mix feelings. Ground service in Edinburgh was outstanding. Expeditious, friendly and they gave me the chance to check a second bag without any extra charge. Service on board was average but friendly. Departure was on time and we arrived 20 minutes earlier, so very well. The plane was an Airbus 319 in pretty good shape, clean and well maintained, however the space between seats was simply ridiculous. It was extremely small even for a midsize person. There would not be a chance to open a laptop and try to work. Happily the person in front of me did not recline, that could have been a disaster. Very bad. Of course there was no entertainment. There was food and beverages for purchase. Due to the space between seats I would avoid flying with BA in short haul flights.",A319,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Edimbourgh to London Gatwick,01/02/2018,no,Verified,8,1,3,-1,3,5,-1
"at least a decade out of date""
",D Dawes,22/02/2018,United Kingdom," Could British Airways get any worse? Flew Chicago - London Heathrow in Upper Deck / Club World, of ancient B747-400, British Airways business class is the worst in the entire global airline industry. The seats are the crazy / odd facing each other, with a rude screen, and are terribly uncomfortable / narrow. They must be at least a decade out of date. The food / wine was simply awful, and they didn't have the lamb on the menu, but replaced it with some kind of beef mush. The crew were young, uneducated, and unprofessional. They were waiters and waitresses at best, and didn't seem to have the social skills requisite to serving business people. Club Class on this route was also full of screaming children, one of whom threw up on the flight. WHY do BA hold their premium customers in such contempt? I can give you the answer: They have a monopoly from the UK to the USA, and back, and no legitimate competition.",Boeing 747-400,Business,Business Class,Chicago to London Heathrow,01/02/2018,no,Verified,7,1,1,1,3,1,1
"has adopted the low cost airline mentality""
",24 reviews,22/02/2018,Greece," Flew on British Airways from Athens to London. The aircraft was a Boeing 757. At the age of 20 years, the aircraft showed its age inside and outside as well as the seating. Apart from this we were slightly delayed leaving but caught up time in flight so landed on time. Unfortunately BA has adopted the low cost airline mentality of having to buy food and drinks which is a shame as they used to be a lovely airline but I guess we will need to live with it as prices are competitive.",Boeing 757,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to London,01/02/2018,yes,Verified,1,3,4,-1,4,5,2
"meals were served very slowly""
",S Stevens,21/02/2018,United Kingdom," The best thing about this flight from London Heathrow to Miami was it’s punctuality. However having got up at 5am for the flight time at 10.45, if we hadn’t eaten breakfast in the airport we would have been starving by the lunch service, which was served what seemed like a long time after take off. 6 hours after the mediocre lunch were were served an even more mediocre sandwich. Only one cabin staff for premium economy service meant drinks and meals were served very slowly by the hard worked lady. Aircraft an elderly 747 and showing its age. Screen tiny, scratched and hardly worth looking at. We have flown similar routes on Thomas Cook and TUI planes and the service and comfort of their new aircraft was miles ahead of this BA flight, which I think is shameful for the national carrier.",Boeing 747,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Miami,01/02/2018,no,Verified,5,2,3,2,3,2,2
Boarding was disappointing,5 reviews,20/02/2018,United Kingdom,"  I've been flying to Bombay for the last seven years to teach there. For most of those seven years I have flown Jet, but decided to try BA this time. Terminal 5 Heathrow flowed smoothly from kerbside to the gate. Boarding was disappointing because there was no discipline in how the aircraft was boarded. Logic suggests you board from the back of the aircraft but when I questioned one of the staff, I was told they had stopped doing this over two years ago.  The flight was smooth, the seat significantly more comfortable than Jet's, the food good, and the service great. The steward who looked after my area was both friendly and authoritative. IN economy class, I can only book my seat 24 hours before takeoff. I can book the seat of my choice earlier if I wish to pay, and that was what I wanted to do with my Avios points, but you cannot.  I was told that several Executive Club members and Avios point collectors had made the same complaint, and that BA might consider allowing its customers to reserve seats with Avios points. BA, judging from this experience, does not know whether it is a full-exercise or a low-cost airline.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Bombay,01/12/2017,yes,Verified,4,4,5,4,3,5,4
so much for a full-service airline,13 reviews,18/02/2018,United Kingdom," Flew short haul business class with British Airways, Manchester - Gothenburg via London Heathrow. It's a diffcult one to review, some aspects of the travel were excellent and others unacceptable. We used points to travel, so what we paid was fine, though would never pay a full BA business short haul fee. We have family in Sweden so took 70kgs (gifts etc) of luggage with us for our four night trip. Check-in was fine both ends, all fights on-time (just about) and no luggage issues, a positive. The staff were friendly though clearly demoralised and actively encouraged to email/publish our concerns. We had a mixture of fortunes with the catering MAN-LHR, nice cold meat platter (30 min flight). LHR-GOT three dried up finger sandwiches, no alternative offered, were told could not take from the M&S menu in economy either. One reason for this, because we ordered an asian veg meal once years ago and apparently this stays on the system. I was told to change my profile details on BA site - once home I looked it clearly says meal options - none, i.e. no special menu (confusing to say the least). Thus the catering became an issue on the remaining three flights. We were told in economy you had to purchase everything, even water, however if in an emergency tap water could be provided - so much for a full-service airline! Any newspapers also gone from business class. On LHR-GOT route there was no divide put up between business and economy, so a 'free for all' to the front toilet. Leg room not great, even fully paying business class passengers have to purchase a seat (more than 24h) in advance (£21 for the frist row and £18 for the rest), which is ridiculous if you had paid £400 return. Lounges OK - preferred MAN to LHR (which is busy and looking worn already). The down-scaling of BA and the mix of pretending to be a full-service airline, but having budget airline ideals and practices is both confusing and not on. The FAs were a saving grace, though rest assured, they are not happy. We'll use up our existing points, though definiately not our airline of choice.",A319/320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Manchester to Gothenburg via London Heathrow,01/02/2018,no,Verified,9,2,3,2,3,2,1
food has noticeably improved,O Thompson,15/02/2018,United Kingdom," A fairly average flight to Cape Town and return. The old 777s they use out of Gatwick are incredibly dated but the economy seats are fairly comfortable. The TV screen is very small and fuzzy (and had to be reset on the journey home to get it working) but the selection of entertainment is OK. The food has noticeably improved since last time we flew with British Airways long haul and all meals were tasty and a decent size and it was nice to receive a hot breakfast before arrival on both journeys. As always with BA the crew were mixed – some were helpful and really friendly, others were borderline rude.

utterly appalling food,F Meares,10/02/2018,United Kingdom,  Orlando to Gatwick. The flight was OK but let down by utterly appalling food. The chicken curry was dry and congealed and devoid of any flavour. It was mainly just rice. The biggest insult was breakfast which was a pretzel filled with cream cheese and a very dry cereal bar - no fruit bits in it - just like eating sawdust. Who on earth though that a cream cheese pretzel was an acceptable breakfast? Bizarre and ridiculous. Looking around the cabin very few were eaten. I commented to the stewardess that it was not a breakfast dish and she replied that it did not look at all appetising.

Flight boarded on time, but twenty minutes before departure the pilot announced that take off would be delayed as luggage was still to be loaded, and engineers were working to replace a pin. Two hours twenty minutes later flight was finally airborne. Cabin staff throughout the the flight were unpleasant and unhelpful. The BA premium is product nowhere near as good as other operators economy offering. The promised fine China dining experience only relates to main course. All other food and drink was served in plastic. The entire meal came on a cluttered tray, dumped on to tray tables with no finesse whatsoever. The chick pea starter was icy cold, the main course lamb over cooked, tasteless and inedible. Dessert and cheese portions were minuscule. Entertainment screen was marbled and very small. Reformatting films to fit to near postage stamp proportions made viewing impossible. Breakfast service made no pretence to premium service. Served on plastic and to be eaten with plastic cutlery.

"if we want anything, get it yourself",Jonathan Grimshaw,22/01/2018,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Tobago. Many years since I've flown in BA club class. Interested to see if all the bad reviews are justified. Outbound flight to Tobago on 1 January was delayed 2 hours because cleaners hadn't turned up. Floor around seat not vacuumed properly. Looked for flight attendant to see if my jacket could be hung up. FA took jacket from me and stuffed it into overhead locker. Invited over PA system to read High Life magazine - not in seat pocket - had to ask. Pre-flight drinks served ok. When asked for meal choice, options didn't correspond with what was on menu. Asked FA if I had wrong menu. FA insisted it was right menu. Looked again and FA said it was wrong menu and brought correct one. Meal ok: fillet of beef took a bit of sawing but tasty. Seat was comfortable, if snug. Ying/yang seat layout makes it hard for FAs to see if you have empty cups etc to clear away on your meal tray unless you're in an aisle seat. Meal tray not horizontal. Didn't bother to watch movie as screen quality poor. Flight had caught up a bit on arrival at Antigua for stopover but was delayed a further 4 hours by need to replace faulty oil indicator. Arrived Tobago 5 hrs late. Return overnight flight left Tobago on time. Old school FAs on board - attentive, capable, unobtrusive. Don't think BA trains them like that any more. Meal tray came with dessert already on it I hadn't selected. When converted to bed, seat is good for length but cramped widthwise so you can't bend your legs, as I do, in sleep. Got a couple of hrs sleep lying on my back. Seems fairly common for FAs on other airlines to come through occasionally during the night asking, if you're obviously awake, if they can get you anything. Not on this flight. I guess if we want anything you have to get it yourself from the uninspiring ""Club Kitchen"". Breakfast ok and flight arrived slightly early. I can remember when a flight on BA club class was something to look forward to. Cabin crew were proud to be work for them and it shone through in the service.

That is incorrect because the online system doesn't accept American Airlines strap tag numbers.

I called the local number they gave me, but the call was routed every time back to Madrid who again refused to take the claim. Finally, on about my third attempt to reason with the agents I found a young lady who was helpful and took my claim. However, I did not still see my suitcase until four days later.

I know BA Club Seats are not ideal, but nevertheless they are still more comfortable than any Middle East airline I have flown with. Entertainment screen poor and needs urgent revamp, cannot see when lights are on in the cabin. Very nice to see a mixed aged crew that shows ageism does not exist at BA. I also must commend BA for their quick medical response to a passenger who had collapsed on the aircraft in club. There rapid response and actions probably saved his life, I flew on 12 January.

Glass of champagne upon boarding, premium whiskies and a nice fillet of steak for dinner. Cabin crew came by constantly to see how I was doing on both legs. Lie flat seat gave me 5+ hours of sleep on both flights. The seat itself was not as wide as I anticipated and the lie flat bed can feel somewhat claustrophobic but legroom is no issue. The 787-9 is a fantastic aircraft. Comfortable and quiet. Fast track passes an added plus. Flying out of San Jose is a bonus since I'm a ten minute drive to home.

It's an incosistent product, as on the outbound flight there was service, on the inbound flight no service. They should decide, if they are a full-service airline or low cost. I understand that they are under pressure, but they are usually more expensive than Lufthansa  and a completely different story, if compared to easyjet.

Nice aircraft with good legroom and a friendly crew, providing a drink and a snack on this 40min flight. Inbound flight had a delay of 45 mins again because an other plane had a technical problem so on that point BA needs to improve. Also check in via BA-app didn't work both ways, so again there's room for improvement.

Price can be high though, especially when you have checked luggage, but we hadn't and I booked well in advance. Paid 200 euros rtn for two, which was fine.

need to roll out promised changes,Michael Palmer,08/01/2018,Canada,"  Toronto to London return – business to London and First back to Toronto all on Avios. Fast check in at Pearson with the usual friendly check in team. Fast track was quick and in the new 3rd party lounge within 15 mins. BA (presumably to save money) have shut their lounge and gone to a 3rd party provider – Premium Plaza. Its frankly awful, no class or professionalism, with limited wine and spirits options, and cheap and nasty food piled high. Elevator music drove us mad, and we were pleased to leave the lounge prematurely to board the aircraft - (what on earth are you thinking BA?) Fast boarding, though with fewer crew, the boarding service in club is fragmented. Late with Champagne, wash bag after take off etc. With only four crew working club, there just isn’t time to offer a quality pre flight experience. The new tray service for drinks is more professional but took ages. We were served drinks 80 minutes into the flight and as we were near the back of the cabin, had our meal 10 mins after being served drinks. All choices were available but the food is just not club standard. Poor entrees, cheap salads and reminiscent of economy food of 15 years ago. BA really need to roll out the new meal service quickly – how long does the new pilot service to New York have to last for?? Got some sleep, had an okay fast breakfast (passed on the vile looking egg and bacon muffin) with an early arrival and bags topping off a better than expected flight. Returning on first was one of my better experiences via the new First check in, fast track and Concorde lounge. Excellent service on boarding, a fast drinks service after take off and some really well cooked food –all choices available. Some decent sleep was followed by a really average afternoon tea. Dry sandwiches with mean fillings, but okay cakes and scones. Early arrival at the gate was spoilt by very slow bags (45 mins after landing). These were my first mixed fleet Biz and first class service experiences. The crew were young, and lacking experience / knowledge but make an enthusiastic, polite and smart. However, they were clearly following the book to the letter which leads to slower and wooden service. Long haul crew were cranky at times, but they would connect better and offer a more sleek / fast service which is what is needed on east coast flights. Flowers have returned to the first class bathrooms, and the slide in quality and cuts in service seemed to have stopped, but BA really need to roll out the promised changes faster to retain premium customers.",Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,First Class,Toronto to London,01/01/2018,no,Verified,8,4,4,4,3,4,3
British Airways customer review,Paul Renshaw,08/01/2018,United Kingdom,"  Las Vegas to Manchester via London. Fairly dire as always. BA is cutting the new Club World product as I speak, before even having rolled it out. Addicted to cuts. Perfect partner for AA. So I get on board and am told I now need to purchase food and beverages on the domestic leg, so why did I not fly a low cost airline? There no difference whatsoever? The crew seemed fresh out of school and so inexperienced. And what do you get for food on a transatlantic 10 hour flight to Vegas? A starter of lettuce and carrot and two unripe cherry tomatoes. No oil, just some grey vinegar, it was foul I assume, nobody ate it. The main was tomato pasta or curry. The curry was so appalling I ate none of it. The chicken was like paste, the sauce dried out, and the rice overcooked. I cannot bear fruit so the only normal looking thing, a mini blueberry muffin, was given to my ravenous neighbour. No cheese, crackers these days, nothing. Served with cold tea. I really loved, also, being rammed on a transfer bus from T3 to LHR T5 having waited 30 minutes to get on bus sweating like crazy. The driver just kept shouting to move down the bus, it won't leave until it is full! Then the busses onto the back of the plane even though the bridge is on. And to top it all of, BA now offers a free copy of the Sun instead of the Mail or Express. I have another flight in May which is non-refundable, I am desperately hoping they move my flight so I can cancel, they usually do this 2 or 3 times a booking so feeling good. This is not a full service airline. It is fully no frills. The only exception is, I think, is the long haul canteen meal you get. The airline is a national embarrassment. The flight attendants try and have to cope with what they have been given, but the ground staff are beyond it. Fly this budget airline at your own peril, think about spending a bit more.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good the flight was from LHR-JNB, I booked this flight as it was a direct flight, and although it was around £130 more than Emirates and Qatar airways, it saved around 10 hours off of the journey. The A380 seats were reasonably comfortable and I had plenty of leg room, the cabin crew were professional and prompt when requested. Inflight entertainment was ok with a good selection of movies (they do need updating though as some were released early 2017), lack of onboard WiFi is a big letdown too. Food was standard airline food, neither good or bad but ok.

currently looking for the luggage,L Vanton,17/12/2017,United Kingdom,"  London to Houston. Executive gold club refused to help me or keep us informed about the case that did not get put on to the flight they subsequently missed another two days of flights at 6 possible flights per day. The staff were steadfastly of the opinion that this is not problem because we have received a card with 801 USD to buy essential items and that is sufficient in their eyes, furthermore they were more interested in leaving to go home and had ticked all the boxes at their end. Needless to say that because we are away for Christmas & New Year we cannot wear the basics for dinner another fact that really made no impact nor was it of any consequence to gold club team. I repeatedly explained that we could not attend dinner without the proper attire which is currently residing in the case that BA and baggage handlers have deemed less than priority. Because we have been given 801 USD No phone calls can be made to update us and the website advises that they are currently looking for the luggage which would be the same case that was dismissed from being loaded onto today's flight. Furthermore the suitcase could go on a minimum of 6 flights per day including the actual day it was not sent as there was a later flight which would have reunited the bag with the owner & negated the requirement of giving us 801 USD in the first place The callous disregard and blatant contempt displayed throughout this ordeal has ruined our holiday to the extent that we have requested BA return us home where we can collect the suitcase ourselves. The tag that may have fallen off is of no concern as everyone is well aware the shell of the case has the bar code stickers on it for that exact reason so that you can track the items.",Boeing 777,Family Leisure,First Class,London to Houston,01/12/2017,no,Verified,1,3,3,1,1,1,3
biggest disappointment was the cabin crew,Omar Swidan,15/12/2017,United Kingdom," Flew British Airways from Dubai to London Heathrow. Overnight flight that departed on time and arrived 25 minutes early to a very easy to navigate through T5. Unfortunately this was the only positive aspect of my flight. Flight was on board a very old 744 with very poor inflight entertainment. B747 are beautiful old planes but the interiors should be updated. The food was OK. The biggest disappointment was the cabin crew who all seemed miserable and not interested. No smiles or even a ""welcome on board"" whilst walking down the aisle. On arrival they were standing together talking and laughing and not even acknowledging any of the passengers. The service provided by BA has significantly declined over the past few years. Even the newer planes (B777 and B787) haven't got cabins that compete with todays market. Also, just like other budget airlines, you now have to pay to choose your seat.

First of all, our flight was two hours late which made me miss my connecting flight in LHR. However, the crew on the ground handled the situation quite well and provided all passengers with food-vouchers and even the captain came out of the plane to explain the situation. However, there was no information on connecting flights in LHR.

"a poor economy class product""
",2 reviews,10/12/2017,United Kingdom," Flew British Airways to Pisa due to flight times and BA miles. Overall a poor economy class product. The seats were really tight. Staff were ok, but seemed stressed. You had to pay for food in economy which is new norm of BA and they predict other airlines will follow suit. Difficult to get a glass of water. Three requests and then it materialised and that too for a young child. At check-in their automated system failed so it was done manually - thank goodness for carbon units still employed by BA. Overall BA is dramatically failing. Those who have BA miles will exhaust them and shift to other airlines. BA is no longer UK's national airline. The magic of Alex Cruz and Willie Walsh is not working if it ever did. Avoid if you are paying up front rfor your tickets.

no longer a full service airline,H Kawaldha,10/12/2017,United Kingdom,  London to Toulouse. British Airways is no longer a full service airline. To compete with EasyJet and Ryan Air it has removed food and drink from economy class and replaced with M&S food. This is over-priced and not that great. Secondly the food was never complementary- it was included in your ticket price. This was the case in this flight to Toulouse. Next time go to Pret and get a meal from there and carry it on board. I asked for a glass of water. This came in the last 30 minutes of the flight once the trolley had gone down the aisle. At least offer people water - it is a human right. The seats too are tight and a rear toilet in economy has been removed to maximise profits. In this flight there was no spare tissue or toilet roll.  I was told by the cabin crew when I asked about the new service level that more may be in store for BA's comers - charging for food in economy class for long haul flights. I hope that this is not true. The only saving grace is a comprehensive network and flight times are good. Customer care and service has gone. Avoid BA if you can. Consume your BA miles and shift to other full service carriers. They are better and more responsive.,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Toulouse,01/10/2017,no,Verified,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

While the terminal, staff, aircraft, and seats are of the same high standards as before - the free in-flight meals and beverages have disappeared and must now be purchased. It seems that BA is slowly morphing into a low-cost carrier at least as far as European destinations are concerned. Presumably, this is due to the competition from Easyjet and Ryanair as well as it's CEO hailing from Vueling.

the worst travel experience,Heidy Lopez,03/12/2017,Canada,"  Vancouver to Edinburgh via London was the worst travel experience I have had. I was travelling with 2 seniors (+85 & +70) we requested assistance and nobody showed up at any of the gates neither departing nor arriving. We actually had to beg for help. The distance between gates is far and too much walking for seniors. In our way from London to Edinburgh it was a nightmare. The flight was delayed and we got to London about an hour late, on top of that we asked for assistance to take the 2 seniors to the next gate and no one seemed to care. The 2 seniors had to walk all that way. It was not only the walking, it was the rush they had, as we had to go trough immigration and the next flight was living in less than 1:30 hours. On our way back from Inverness to Canada another nightmare despite we requested assistance in advance. Once again there was nobody waiting for the seniors at the gate. Again we had to beg for assistance and the British Airways staff did not seem to know or care about this. They said that they called the buggy and that was all. We said that we were going to miss the airplane as the gates/ terminal distance were far and no one seemed to care at all. We were lucky I asked a gentleman who was driving one of the buggy and passed by and he kindly accept to take the seniors to take the bus area from terminal 5 to 3 (in London) and then arranged for them to be picked up in terminal 3 and after security point. This gentleman who is not British Airways employee provided a great service. Summarizing the only good experience we had was with an external person that just by chance I asked and he decided to help us out. Seats were another problem. We did the online check in (24 before) and we had the seats already chosen 12D for one senior (isle) and 18D (isle) for the other senior. When we got to the counter in Inverness Airport the agent told us there were not seat chose even though we had prove and the boarding who was sent by email showing the seats. Then the agent put the seniors almost at the end of the airplane and in the middle seats. So once again, more walking for them, problems to get in/out the seats, and of course problem to get to the washroom. - luggage another problem! British Airways in Inverness said that the luggage goes directly to Victoria and that we did not have to pick it up in Vancouver. Surprise surprise! We went through customs and when we got to Westjet counter for the connection to Victoria they asked for the luggage.  They said we had to pick it up before going through customs. There was no way to go back to the carousel, so we had to wait for the Westjet staff to contact somebody from British Airways to get us to the carrusel and take the luggage. So nightmare again!! And another rush to us to get to the next fligh. According to Westhet agents they said that British airways should have had the assistance for the seniors and of course pick the luggage with them and bring it to the connection. What can you expect from British Airways? If It doesn’t even care about the passengers that are seniors and requested assistance. We can only thank Westjet staff who provide the assistance in Vancouver.",Boeing 747-400,Business,Economy Class,Vancouver to Edinburgh via London,01/12/2017,no,Verified,1,2,2,3,1,2,2
Noticeable cost cutting measures,T Mallison,02/12/2017,United Kingdom," London to Berlin Tegel return. It's becoming ever more difficult to notice any difference between British Airways and the budget airlines. The only saving grace is that I've never experienced any issues flying out of or into T5. Noticeable cost cutting measures include the removal of complimentary onboard food and drink but also, BA have removed a toilet in economy within their A319 fleet to make space for seats in row 24 and 25 meaning there is only one economy toilet, disgraceful.

1st product is very mediocre,Clive Drake,01/12/2017,United Kingdom," Flew London Heathrow to Dubai. Arrived at the new ""Wing"" at T5. A quick process and into the Concorde lounge. I noticed (as before) the check in staff do not mention the Concorde lounge per se. ""Just straight through there sir and into the 1st class lounge."" This option was rammed. Am pleased to confirm that the Concorde lounge has had a long overdue make-over. It looks a bit better. Had a snack and a few glasses of fizz - then made my way to terminal B. Friendly FA showed me and wife to our seats. Looked freshly cleaned. Pushed back on time. 1st Class was full. Airborne I had dinner: Mezze to start which was nice. Some chicken thingy for mains - which was horrible. Cheese and biscuits to conclude. Wines were ok. The seat (the new ""First"") - is not wearing well. Looking somewhat tired. Managed to get some sleep on the ""bed"" with the usual duvet and blankets. I am a tall guy and need the space. the Club World option is horrendous. Very pleased to confirm that Mr Alex Cruz (BAs CEO) has re-introduced flowers in the 1st WC. Readers will recall he cancelled these last year to save costs. If Mr Cruz wants to save costs he should get rid of the gas guzzlers 747-400s. So a full 1st cabin will generate about £40,000 of revenue. The flowers (for 2 WCs) probably cost £8.00 - so, pleased to see the airline is still flying and not gone bankrupt over the re-introduction of eight quids worth of flowers per flight. The 1st product is very mediocre compared with say Emirates. Some have said its ""sort of an upmarket Business class"". I'd agree with that. One would think, BA would want to make a big impression on this route - with at least some high end food. ""Logic"" is not something BA seem to understand - given the high level of negative reviews on this site.

sad experience from our national carrier,Clive Drake,01/12/2017,United Kingdom," Flew British Airways from Dubai to London Heathrow. Arrived at Dubai airport, checked in - and endured horrendous security. Not BAs fault. Walked miles to the ""new"" lounge. It's a weird set up.

Airbourne I went for lunch straight away - after a couple of G&Ts. Arabic lamb starter. Boring and tasteless. No other options. Skipped the soup. Had a salad. The beef mains was very good - not exceptional and no wow factor. Just nice. Red wine was OK - mid priced stuff at about £25 a bottle. My wife was told the beef was now ""unavailable"". My friend had beef and so did I - when challenged on this I was told - only 3 beefs aboard! This flight was again full and had been for weeks. 14 people. 3 beefs. A joke. My wife had an Arab dish which she did not like. When it came to coffee, my friend, then I - had a choice of chocolates. My wife then had the box offered - only to have it more or less demanded back by a pushy FA. Most BA cabin staff are good - this one was a PR disaster. Flight was smooth all the way home.

British Airways is seriously lacking,Corey Diffin,24/11/2017,Singapore," British Airways is seriously lacking in all areas. Singapore to Sydney return in economy. Fly the route often, usually with Qantas which are great. The flight out to Sydney is only 7.5 hours and over night - most people are looking to maximise their sleep. Especially those who have come from London. Cabin crew were surly, unhelpful and seemed rushed and disorganised. After departure they took almost three hours to get the dinner service over and done with and turn off the lights so people could get some rest. During the flight cabin crew chatted loudly and seemed unaware that people may actually want to rest and get some sleep. The food is very average also. Two hours before landing, they serve a pre landing breakfast snack of a sandwich wrapped in plastic. No tea or coffee. The competition is too strong for this route.

BA is shameless and embarrassing,H Peel,24/11/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Basel. Boarding: There are now so many 'priority boarding' passengers that all those who do not fall into this category are left to feel like second-class citizens. (The new numbering system is likely to cement this impression further.) Since I was traveling on a 'low-price' ticket, I found myself seated right at the back of the airplane. Yes, BA appears intent on replicating England's class system!  On board there was a delay of 40 minutes due to a French ATC strike. Obviously, this was not BA's fault, but no drinks, not even water was offered during the wait on the tarmac. After take off, the drinks trolley moved painfully slowly down the cabin. Why BA offer heated sandwiches, further slowing down their BOB service even further, when only two ec cabin crew are serving in the first place, is beyond me. The no-cash policy further contributes to the snail-pace progress of the trolley. The trolley (and a cup of tea) was within grasping distance as the captain announced we would be landing in ten minutes. End of service. Someone at the back quipped, 'So you opted for the premium seats, too!' Yes, BA is a joke, its attitude towards passengers (its customers) shameless and embarrassing. It wasn't until I had left the airport that I was able to get that cup of tea. Needless to say, Eurowings and EasyJet do things much better.",A320,Business,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Basel,01/11/2017,no,Verified,1,2,1,1,1,1,-1
poor quality product crew have to support,William Beard,24/11/2017,United Kingdom,"  Miami to London Heathrow. A bit of a mixed bag. Boarding at Miami was conducted efficiently and the flight departed on time, albeit that some passengers were still getting into their seats as the aircraft was pushed back! So much for safety. Seat would not remain in the upright position resulting in an uncomfortable flight and subsequent aching back on arrival at Heathrow. Also my wife’s IFE failed mid flight. Impossible to hear information from the flight deck. These ageing 747’s really are in desperate need of replacement. The congealed chicken curry was disgusting and unpalatable, the alternative pasta dish was deemed acceptable. The minimal breakfast offering leaves a lot to be desired. The only redeeming feature was the excellent service provided by the young enthusiastic cabin crew. They must feel very demoralised given the poor quality product they have to support.

the worst airline I have flown,D Karnda,23/11/2017,United States,"  Prague to Washington via London. British Airways has turned out to be the worst airline I have flown. Unfortunately I am forced to fly them often from PRG, if I want to connect on their One World partner AA, which I have Exec Plat status with. BA charges for everything, including water. PRG-LHR is on a small business class seat (same as in economy), dried up breakfast that was tasteless, flight attendants that could not care less and when I asked for coffee told me they were landing soon (40 mins before landing) and that I should have thought of it earlier. London to Washington  was on a broken down 747, seat sofa which you are supposed to lie on broke down and caved in on the floor. Had to be moved twice before they found functioning seat. Food was dried up beef with red that gave me a headache after two sips. Entertainment system has about 40 movies, compared to about 200 options on AA flights. Overall horrible experience. The extra added costs for flying over LHR and paying extra  tax is ridiculous. BA, what is it about your flights PRG-LHR, with your onboard luggage allowance only? They charge USD 100 for a checked in luggage even to Emerald partners?  Horrible food, aircraft, LHR and transfer experience. Good luck BA, will avoid at all costs.

An excellent flight,David Ellis,23/11/2017,United Kingdom,"  Cape Town to London. I can report a positive experience on our flight. From the moment we boarded, cabin crew were polite and efficient, and provided a high-class service throughout. Seats 4E/F suffer a bit from poor storage space and a lack of privacy, but they are the best for a couple. Glasses were kept topped-up even before take-off. The menu provided four choices of both starter and mains, and all the dishes were both well-presented and well-cooked. Talking to cabin crew, it seems that staff are now being trained to prepare and present food with greater care, and this really showed on the flight. The IFE screen was the usual low resolution with a limited selection of films. Still no WiFi, of course. Take-off and landing was on schedule, and announcements from the cockpit had that typical air of friendly professionalism.

the CEO is running BA to the ground,B Mantourieux,21/11/2017,Thailand,"  Bangkok to London Heathrow. Despite all the negative reviews I decided to fly with BA on my recent trip to Europe, on this route BA has a daylight flight (I can't stand midnight plus departure and night flight where you can't sleep anyway and arrive at your destination wasted), more luggage allowance in premium economy and they advertised what seemed to be a comfortable cabin and stylish service. The fare was also pretty good. In the end, I have to admit my mates were right, this was a let down all along. My issues were the following. I purchased a ticket in premium economy. The advertised seats on the BA Thailand website were reflecting the newer version, when in fact not one of the 777-200 which operates the LHR-BKK-LHR route have been refitted. The seat date from the early 2000's - almost two decades ago, and I had to pay 35 pounds each way to select my seat. Come on ! Yes I got my amenities kit, a better pillow British papers and pre-departures drinks, a full bar and plenty of drinks to keep me going for 12hr plus. But the seat is old, not that comfy, the IFE belongs to the late 90's and is a disgrace to the industry. Great sound, good headset but rubbish tiny screen with a poor picture quality. I spent 12hr looking at the ceiling as I could not see squat. The seat itself is way outdated and the cabin/seat were dirty. It was however A bit better out of LHR but still not that great. The meal service was not good out of BKK. Bar service did not have peanuts or savory snack - just a napkin. Main dish was ok, but appetizer and dessert a cheap joke. No cheese nor crackers. Not enough at all, you are left starving, and in economy it is even worst. I have to say it was better on the return leg and will give you more details in a bit. Cabin crew told me they just reverted to the old style as they have had way too many complaints and the J/C had a brand new a la carte service as well.  Cabin crew operating both legs were great - professional, approachable and present in the cabin every 30mins with drinks. Out of LHR the main meal was this time pretty good, including cheese and crackers and a much better appetizer plus desert. The only false note was the meal pre-selection. You get served first as they do with special meals - but do not offer you any drinks. You have to wait for a very long time. By then my meal was cold and i sent it back. They did replace it right away, but this was clearly a waste of time. Pre-selecting your meal, means you are sure to get your choice of casserole and that you wish to be served at the same time then others so the bar is right behind and one can enjoy a glass of red with is steak. Pax with Special meals service can wait as the crew have way more to hand out and these veggies lovers often do not drink anyway. Other than that it was this time a decent meal. Having said that, there was no middle service, which meant 9 h between lunch and breakfast without even a snack. Not acceptable on such a long haul. Funny enough the BKK-LHR feature three meals so why not on the LHR-BKK leg ?. BA could be so much better. They have a great force but way too many cost cutting left and right - and should have upgraded all their fleet at least 5 years ago. It is clear to me the CEO is running BA to the ground and needs to get the sack by share holders sooner rather than later .",Boeing 777-200 ER,Business,Premium Economy,Bangkok to London Heathrow,01/09/2017,no,Verified,1,2,4,3,5,3,1
solid product and excellent crew,8 reviews,20/11/2017,United Kingdom,"  Tel Aviv to London. We arrived at the airport with a lot of time due to the stories of how long security can take. The stories were true, although it is actually a very efficient and well organised airport, they just have very thorough border and immigration services as well as all passengers face enhanced security scanning of hand luggage etc. There were limited priority options available for First Class passengers, although I suspect that is more down to the airport than British Airways. The lounge provided is a third party one and is the same for business and first, and isn’t really acceptable. If it was just business then it would be ‘fine I guess’ but there is not very much seating, the food offerings were almost non existent and drinks were limited. Even the main coffee machine was broken so there was another, very complicated, machine with all instructions only in Hebrew. At the gate there was the usual ‘priority boarding’ queue as well as the regular queue. But the priority queue included all first and club passengers as well as all Oneworld emerald, sapphire and ruby members - which is a lot of people! Whilst it is nice to offer a perk to all of those members, there really should be another queue for first and Oneworld emerald as the queue was quite long. The service on board didn’t start off very well for me as due to some confusion amongst the crew I got missed out when crew were offering drinks amenity kits etc, and after seeing every one was finished and the crew were all relaxing at the front I had to go to the galley and ask. They were very apologetic and provided excellent service for the rest of the flight but those kind of mistakes really shouldn’t happen in first. The seat is comfortable and offers a reasonable level of privacy and storage space. Annoyingly the ife has to be stowed for take off and landing, which limits how much you can watch. It was the Thales entertainment system so the quality was reasonable and with a fairly good selection of things to watch. The food and drinks on board were all excellent, including a delicious veal cheek main course and some wonderful wines that went together very well. Aside from the hiccup at the beginning, the whole experience on board felt very attentive and special. It would have been nice to have been referred to by name, which I have had before on BA and with other airlines, even in business class. On arrival the priority bags came out incredibly quickly and were on the belt before we got there, which was impressive as immigration had also been very quick. Overall this was a very nice flight with a solid product and excellent crew, let down only by the ground service in Israel.

was a very enjoyable flight,C Down,20/11/2017,United Kingdom,"  London to Tel Aviv. Arrived at Heathrow at about 5pm expecting it to be very busy, but check and security felt like it was 10pm, very easy and quick process (which included regular rather than fast track security as we didn’t follow the signs properly). We used galleries south lounge and first impressions were actually pretty poor, although they did later improve. The food offering on arrival was a few sandwiches, soup and some dry cake. This wasn’t really acceptable at all although about an hour after we arrived the evening meals were laid out and there was a good selection of hot and cold dishes which were quite tasty. Drinks overall were good as always with British Airways although champagne is only served on request and the quality of the one provided was really quite appalling. In terms of seating, there was enough for all the passengers in there, and it was quite busy, and due to it being broken up into different areas it felt like a nice place, although better variety in seating, including some more comfortable chairs, would be appreciated as well as a bit of modernising. This biggest failing was the staff in the lounge, which were more similar to staff in a factory canteen than what you find in competitors lounges. Smiles are free and go a long way, and whilst being unobtrusive can be a good quality, eerily walking around slightly like a zombie, seruptitiously clearing your table without any interaction whatsoever was just plain odd! The other area which I find completely below standard are the toilets. Whilst they are kept clean and there are some nice touches with flowers etc, the general standard of the toilet decor was more like a cheap gym locker room. The regular Heathrow airport toilets are far far nicer and to a higher quality. Whilst the individual toilet cubicles with self contained wash areas are nice, there aren’t really enough and some regular wash room facilities and urinals as well would make it easier. On board me and my friend had the centre two seats at the very back of the cabin. This meant that we basically had our own private suite as well as direct aisle access. These seats are fantastic when travelling with someone and as good as any business offering from any airline in terms of comfort, privacy and access. Unfortunately this was an ancient 777 with the old ife, which is a completely unacceptable product in terms of resolution, selection and even the fact that some screens won’t even stay in place and fold themselves away! British Airways need to have an active plan to refurbish or replace all of these aircraft, end of story! Even the Thales system is showing its age now, but this Rockwell Collins one makes vhs tapes look state of the art! The cabin crew were slightly mixed in terms of level of service and experience. Some were clearly not in sync with each other when serving drinks and meals etc, and some were rather abrupt and unfriendly. Others however were absolutely wonderful and made the whole flight a wonderful experience. Food and drinks on board were actually quite good, although the on board service was not the new club world one on this route yet. Overall it was a very enjoyable flight, and as I booked using Avios and a companion voucher it was exceptional value for money.

The service was brusque,1 reviews,19/11/2017,Malaysia,"  Kuala Lumpur to Madrid via London. My first time flying BA and I had very low expectations. Fortunately, my experience was pleasant as the seats were generally comfortable and overall service was good. The service (KUL-LHR) was brusque. Meal was served not long after take off and my child was already sleeping as it was past midnight. I had asked if we could have it later but the reply was a curt NO and that they couldn't give it to us later nor would they have any snacks to offer. So if we got hungry we would just have to wait more than 8 hours later for the next meal. Luckily on the return route we had a very courteous cabin crew who spoke politely. Both aircrafts appeared new and the seats were wide enough for us. Some people complained about the entertainment unit under the seats. What I didn't like though is that the arm rest couldn't be kept up totally between the 2 seats so that my child could lie across his seat and mine. The armrest kind of went up to a max of 80 degree angle. The seat pockets were very small so there's very little that can kept inside. The toilets were generally clean but the toilet seat lids didn't work properly. They always fall back down and there was never seat liners.

inflight service was very poor,Christopher Rainbow,19/11/2017,United Kingdom,  Madrid to London Heathrow on a busy Monday evening in November was an entirely mixed affair. Boarding was from the satellite terminal which was efficient and well managed. Boarding was rather slow as too many people were allowed to bring aboard large amounts of luggage. This resulted in some bags being removed and placed into the hold. Some passengers were poorly behaved and argued with the staff. Every single seat was occupied. This was quite hard on the staff. A trendy safety instruction took place with a video of certain UK based TV personalities. This was in English only. The inflight service was very poor. I ordered a sandwich and a drink and had my receipt chucked at me. Disembarkation was slow again due to the large amount of luggage. I regard this as a health and safety matter.

BA is just too cheap on it's product,2 reviews,17/11/2017,South Korea,"  London Heathrow to Seoul Incheon. I was flying my return leg back to Korea after a Christmas vacation. I had not had a pleasant experience on my initial leg and unfortunately had no better experience on the return. To start with, i was unable to pre order my meal on line due to a technical fault. Having not had my selection available on the outbound leg (in business class!) i wanted to ensure i had something for my return. I couldn't pre book and of course when offered the meal by the cabin crew they had AGAIN run out of 50% of the available selections. Quite disgraceful. I was also unable to check in on line, so i was ""directed"" by staff to use the kiosk at the airport which also did not work. Eventually i made it passed the staff and was allowed to queue for the business class check in. The rest of the airport process after that was smooth. This time i sat at the rear of the business class cabin in the window seat. This meant that I did not have to step over somebody else feet and legs if I wanted to get out of my chair in flight. Of course I had to pay extra $'s for the seat selection in business class - a point which i have made before about being very unhappy about in a premium cabin. The flight was uneventful. On this occasion I had a very warm crew for which I appreciated. Overall I still feel that BA is just too cheap on it's product and this is not an acceptable practice especially in a premium class. Frankly, even though they were the cheaper ticket price by the time I had paid extra for the seat and not had my meal choices available i would have been better off flying another carrier.",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to Seoul Incheon,01/01/2017,no,Verified,3,3,4,2,2,3,3
BA is way behind other carriers,2 reviews,16/11/2017,South Korea,"  Seoul Incheon to London Heathrow. This was my first flight on BA for many years. As a Brit, I was actually looking forward to flying them in order to return home for Christmas on board the relatively new B787. I was disappointed. The fare I paid on this occasion was relatively good value for a J class cabin - in my view. However, it was extremely disappointing to see that you have to pay to select your seat in J class. I do not know of and have not ever flown another airline which charges you for this and I certainly do not appreciate it. I was seated in row 1 by the window. My first experience in this cabin was a shock when I realised I was looking straight into the face of the passenger sitting next to me. And further that i had to step over the legs of the passenger in row 2 to get into and out from my seat. The tray table did not sit straight when pulled out for service. Even in row 1, by the time the cabin crew came to take my meal order they were already telling me that two of the available options had already run out. This left me taking a Korean option on a flight on BA where the majority of the passengers seemed to be non-Korean. Clearly something wrong with the meal ratios. They offer a serve yourself snack bar in flight. I went to the galley at one point and there was very little available to take food wise - it was mostly just drinks. It also seemed to be a fixed meal time - something else i do not appreciate in business class these days when dine on demand is a far better option for passengers. The IFE selection was nothing more than average. I found the overall selection somewhat limited compared to other carriers. The service and product simply left me feeling that BA is way behind other carriers and I concluded that i would not make a point of flying with them again on a long haul route in a premium cabin.",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Seoul Incheon to London Heathrow,01/12/2016,no,Verified,2,3,3,3,4,3,3

On the outward journey I was in an aisle seat. Next to me was somebody who was too large to comfortably be able to occupy a middle seat. The crew could have helped the poor person out by offering an aisle but they made no attempt. So three people suffered cramped conditions for 11 hours. The food is awful, poor quality and with poor selection of wines - cheap Spanish wine with no choice, the cabin was over heated. It was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever taken.

Negatives - food on on both legs wasn't great. Salad poor and main beef meal very average. Pudding which is normally the show stopper - not great. In previous years food been excellent. Return journey just the same - except for the crew this time being outstandingly helpful. We were travelling with a baby and a toddler and the crew couldn't do enough to help. The real test of the crew was on landing at LHR, we were walking up the jetty and my 3 year old daughter was sick all over me. We were stood on the jetty trying to sort the situation and all the crew after a long flight came to help us. They were amazing. They didn't have to as they were done for the day.

extra cost not justified,25 reviews,13/11/2017,United Kingdom,"  British Airways short haul Business Class is nothing more than an economy class seat and maximum 31 inch pitch, with lounge access and a meal thrown in. So is it worth paying three times the cost of an economy ticket? BA recently introduced Business Class on domestic routes and as I got a decent price for booking well in advance, decided to try it out. Checking in was efficient, and the Galleries Club Lounge adequate (no comparison whatsoever with Asian or Middle Eastern Airline lounges). Priority boarding although announced, did not make any difference as economy and business class passengers were in the same queue and confused. Having maneuvered into the cramped seat, I was offered a hot towel as soon as I sat down. I couldn't decide whether to be amused or embarrassed by the new celebrity cast safety video. It was more spot the stars, than listen to the safety instructions. But I guess it was something different BA was trying out. The service on board was surprisingly efficient and swift. Soon after take off, a tasty snack and bar service with premium brands was offered on this one hour flight. The service was good, considering a one hour flight. Despite a Boeing 767, 2x2x2 layout, the cabin felt claustrophobic. To me, this was no different than economy seating, with virtually no leg room. How can this be branded as Business Class?

need to clean the planes more often,G Searle,11/11/2017,United Kingdom,"  London to Santiago. Cabin crew generally helpful and friendly. Cabin a bit grubby; crumbs, nuts and grime in evidence. On the flight home as I took my seat I saw a bit of the wrapper of the ear plugs they give out which seemed to have been left over from the previous flight - evidence that whoever wields the vacuum cleaner before the passengers board needs to be a bit more thorough. The alcoholic drinks were all pleasant. The food was of variable quality (as was the coffee) none bad, some a bit mediocre, some good. Many have commented on the somewhat odd seat arrangement and I found it a bit of a palaver to have to carefully step over another, sleeping, passenger's legs trying not to wake them up. The other problem with that configuration is the video screen has to be stowed at take off and landing which means you can't watch it, as you can in economy when the screen is on the back of the seat in front of you. On both flights I found that my screen seemed to be broken and would not lock in position so that I would have to look at it at an angle. I solved the problem by stuffing a rolled up magazine in the hinge bit, but then I had to take it out every time I got out of my seat. Another problem with the configuration is that the storage space is minimal; apart from the overhead lockers there is only a small drawer. And that adds to the litter problem. After you have taken off the polythene wrappers for your headphones and blanket or the paper ring around your napkin, what do you do with it? Er, drop it on the floor? I did manage to sleep quite well, though the pillow you are provided with is very thin. On the flight back they gave me another one when I asked. Another small problem is that there is no individual air conditioning vent for your seat and if you take off your jacket, sweater or whatever, the lack of storage space means it has to go in the overhead locker if you have already filled up the little drawer. And I don't want to seem a bit picky, but although the in-flight entertainment has a good choice of films, the menu system for seeing what they are is a bit irritating; they are all divided into categories such as ""comedy"", ""thrillers"" etc but no A-Z. All in all, it wasn't an unpleasant experience but I would advise BA, if they were interested in my advice, that they need to clean the planes more often and more thoroughly and re-think the seat configuration.",Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Santiago,01/11/2017,yes,Verified,8,3,4,3,4,3,3

After reading very mixed reviews here, I also saw that BA were upgrading standards on flights to NYC in particular and was looking forward to my flight. Should not have been so optimistic, as this is still a business class that belongs in the 1980's. Aircraft was tatty to be polite about it, worn carpets, seat with various malfunctioning or broken items, washrooms grimy from the word go. Staff tried hard to offer a modicum of good service, but the so called food improvements were really not much better than other premium economy cabins I have flown when I have to pay for the ticket.

disappointed with the return flight,C Ward ,10/11/2017,United Kingdom,"  London to Mumbai. The electrics at my seat were not working. This may have been related but the remote control that was completely broken with loose  wires etc. - The call button light kept coming on and off on its own. It was impossible for me to control this and at the time that I did actually want to contact the flight attendant, I had to use my husband's remote control to do so. - Because the connection was loose on my remote, it meant that things were changing on my TV screen without me being able to control it e.g. I would press play on the screen, then the program would pause or start rewinding without me doing anything. Because my remote controller was broken, it would not return properly into the socket and kept 'pinging' back out. This was  annoying when you are trying to relax in your seat. The TV screen was  faulty. The usual 'push and release' button did not work, I had to push the button and then just try to 'pull' the screen, it was very tough. Even the cabin crew could not release it properly. My footrest was very stiff and hard to manoeuvre on my own - my husband had to help every time I wanted to move this. My husbands footrest was  broken - The charging socket at my seat did not work, so I could not charge my phone or laptop for the entire flight. My husbands charging socket also did not work. the flight attendant told me that this was an issue on some of the other seats in our row. This is not related to my seat however the storage unit above my seat/row kept opening throughout the flight. The attendant would shut it and then it would  open, this happened during take off and landing, as well as throughout the flight.  For this level of airline and Club World seat, it is not acceptable that you should have to rely on your personal equipment.  This return flight was the first time that I have flown business class. We have spent tens of thousands of pounds on our American Express card to earn the points required and to generate the companion voucher, for us to be able to fly business class for our honeymoon. Whilst the outbound flight was great, I was very disappointed with the return flight and shocked by the poor quality of the seat. The hostess tried to reset my screen which made no difference and in fact, the situation got worse. Once I had tried to turn on the screen and once it the hostess had attempted a re-set; after that, the screen just kept flicking on and off for the remaining 3.5 hrs of the flight. As you can imagine, it is very annoying to have a screen flick on and off with no way of controlling it.

BA is now grossly overpriced,Michael Edwards,01/11/2017,United Kingdom,"  New York to London Heathrow.  First class check in at T7 in JFK was quick, polite staff provide better service than those at Heathrow. The Concorde Room is just a few metres after security.  It is nice enough with a good range of seating and dining booths, but washroom / shower facilities are downmarket. Selected a couple of a la carte menu choices and these were nicely presented and tasty. Boarding was reasonably efficient,  and staff onboard offered usual boarding drinks, pyjamas etc. Delay of about 30 mins on departure was made up during the flight. I opted to sleep straight after take off,  seat comfort is okay if a little narrow.  90 minutes before arrival I had some fruits and pastry for breakfast,  accompanied by some good coffee. While I only needed minimal service onboard,  the staff were courteous and efficient,  and they are one of very few good things left after BA after their CEO seems to have decided to alienate loyal customers of 40 years!  Arrival into T5 at Heathrow,  B satellite at 0515 was absolute bedlam, and a reason I would choose another airline on this route. We wanted for 4 satellite trains to pass by totally full before we could even get to the main Terminal -  to find Immigration in total,  disorganised chaos.

on-board experience was good,29 reviews,30/10/2017,United States,"  This was my first time flying with British Airways from Los Angeles to London Heathrow. I was able to secure a window seat for myself (without paying any fee) during online check-in 24 hours prior to departure. The baggage drop-off experience at LAX and LHR was smooth. At LAX, the BA staff tags your check-in bags, at LHR, you have to do it yourself. The on-board experience was good. This was my first time sitting on the upper-deck of A380 (which had a special storage bin by the window armrest). Food options were consistent with what you find on most transatlantic flights (Chicken or Pasta). There was no WiFi, but BA had a good collection of movies. I enjoyed BA's in-flight ""movie snack"" as well. The ""Flight Map / Tracker"" wasn't working on one segment, which was a bit surprising.

pleasant and well organised,C Barton,29/10/2017,United Kingdom,  Gatwick to Cagliari proved to be a rather pleasant and well organised affair. The website was easy to use and very clear. I checked-in online and simply had to drop off my bag. I arrived very early for the flight and noted that there was quite a queue already. The boarding process was quick and efficient and the interior of the aircraft was clean. My seat was comfortable for a short flight. The captain made clear and informative announcements and the two crew I could see worked very hard and were pleasant. The crew made use of Italian and were cheerful and professional. My gripe is the awful use of Marks and Spencer food. This has to be purchased and a good few items were not available. There were no route maps and no entertainment systems. The lavatory was clean.

gripe is about the current food service,2 reviews,27/10/2017,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Marrakech. Generally a well organised flight and fairly full in Y class. My gripe is about the current food service. This was a fairly long short-haul flight scheduled for 3h 45m in which a reasonable meal service would be welcome and desirable. After a lot of comments from others who have flown BA recently we bought food in the terminal before departure as the coho-ice on board is very limited, especially as much seems to be already 'sold out'. The biggest issue is about the time taken to do the food selling. It took almost all of the flight time for the crew to work through the plane to serve every row even though I observed that about 60% of passengers bought nothing. Of course this led to problems for those wishing to go to the toilets at the rear when food service starts at the front, any passengers from front to middle have no access to aft toilets after the trolley has passed. Passengers resorted to using the forward toilets passing through business class which I assume was not welcomed by those passengers. I overheard a crew member saying that they were not going to duty free sales as they were out of time. It is ridiculous that this paid and limited service takes so long. I remember the days when a British Midland crew could serve a full cooked breakfast with tea or coffee to all 100 or so pax on a LHR to Middlesbrough flight scheduled for 40 minutes or an Aer Lingus crew serving hot breakfast to all on a turbulent flight of 1 hr from Dublin to London.

a dismal airline to fly with,K Gaulin,25/10/2017,Singapore,"  Singapore to Nassau via Heathrow. British Airways is becoming a dismal airline to fly with. I will start with the worst and shocking aspect of my flight from Heathrow to Singapore on Oct 23. There were bugs on the flight and I have bites all over my body at least at a dozen places. One can suffer the bad food, service / behavior of cabin staff but having one's health compromised is unacceptable. The toilets were filthy. I was in the paid premium seat (front row) and I could smell the toilet from there. The attitude of staff ranges of sweet to indifferent and curt sometime for no rhyme or reason. The food is inconsistent and becomes a pain when you are on a long haul flight because there are no options available. While flying from Nassau to Heathrow, the dinner was fine but the breakfast (I think it was a morning snack), consisted of a croissant which was a cold lump, coffee which was cold and a oats snack bar. I mean, you cant get a croissant right? The inflight entertainment was mediocre at best and remains much to be desired. The screens in the Singapore- Heathrow sectors were ok to use but the Heathrow to Nassau sector were malfunctioning all the time. I could feel the fingers of the passengers sitting behind me trying to function the 'touch screen'; more like punch screen. The flights were mercifully on time and full marks for that this time. It could learn well from airlines like Singapore Airlines which are pretty consistent and clean.

Cabin crew chatting and ignored me,Alan Thompson,23/10/2017,United Kingdom,"  Bari to Gatwick. More of the same. All held together by cockpit crew. Follows my review of the outbound leg a week back. Check in excellent, not BA staff and security at Bari a breeze. Boarding well organised. Cabin crew chatting to each other as I boarded and ignored me. This is inexcusable. Flight fine, ahead of schedule and good updates from cockpit. Didn’t buy anything this time, smell of coffee far better than the taste from previous experience. Gatwick South unpleasant tho not BA’s fault. Endless staircases, broken escalator and a long walk to security where half the e-gates were out of action. Baggage hadn’t arrived anyway despite being priority so delay at security irrelevant. Had an offer to upgrade to Club for £89 - a joke as there is no lounge at Bari and the onboard value is a max of £30. I do still like flying BA as much as I don’t Easy or Ryanair.

service levels are dropping so low,P Leane,22/10/2017,United Kingdom,"  Early morning 0710 flight London Heathrow to Gibraltar. Now I know that British Airways have started charging for food and drink on European flights but their service levels are dropping so low that they are now no better than Ryanair or Easyjet. It might be M&S food, but if you can't get any that does not help. We were seated at the rear of the cabin, since BA started to charge I have noticed that there is only 1 food cart which started at the front. Before there would have been 2 with 1 at the front and 1 at the rear, now by the time the cart get to you it is 1.5 hrs into the flight and they have run out of most things.

Time to find a new CEO I think,Clive Drake,21/10/2017,United Kingdom,"  Pisa to Gatwick. I fly this route often as I have a home in Tuscany. Believe me it does not get any better - but the option is Ryanair and that's worse. Flight started in the new South Terminal lounge. The decor and layout of the facility is great. No problems here although it's located in a ""not so easy place"" to find. Breakfast food was ghastly. Cheap baps with greasy bacon or a dried up ""eggy"" thing. Horrible. Didn't touch it and those that did - left it as confirmed by numerous plates with half eaten baps. Had tinned fruit salad and yoghurt plus a G&T. Yes I know, bit early in the day! Short walk to the gate. Plane left on time. the usual horrible 3 for 2 seats in Club Europe. The front row made it easier - but only just. Had a pleasant lunch of chicken and couscous salad. The plane was very old. This was confirmed by the WC. Originally the loo flush button was blue. After 100,000 + uses the blue was partly eroded by finger presses, to a grey colour. The loo basin cannot be described here. Plane landed on time. The Captain came out and I had a nice chat with him. Very nice bloke. Return flight started in the shared lounge. It okay but can get busy. Same plane back (recognizable by the flush button in the loo - unless all the BA319s are like it). Skipped the meal as I'd eaten lunch in Pisa. It looked nice though. A few gin and tonics to suppress my irritation at what a shoddy product Club Europe is. Great flight back into the setting sun. FAs on all flights were great. Morale very low thanks to the miserable, mean cost cutting by the BA CEO, Mr Cruz, who has no idea on how to run an airline. I first flew BA in 1980 and what a difference.

The entertainment system was old and slow, and low definition. The Premium Economy cabin was directly behind First Class, and those passengers kept using the First Class toilets.

a good deal on the flight,8 reviews,20/10/2017,United Kingdom,"  Faro to Gatwick. Check in was quiet at the club Europe desk and I was very quickly booked in. Fast track security at the airport wasn’t particularly well managed, although I did get through quicker than I would have otherwise. Disappointingly British Airways do not provide any lounge access at Faro, and there is currently a lot of construction taking place in the main departure lounge, and the builders are not exactly considerate with the noise! There was no priority queue at the entrance to the gate and as usual British Airways did a fairly half hearted job at ensuring priority boarding of the aircraft itself. The aircraft was the new style, which I think is very smart and nicely decorated (not budget airline as some commentators like to say), and whilst the legroom isn’t amazing I am 6’ tall and was quite comfortable and having the extra table space makes it a more usable space. The cabin crew were very friendly and professional whilst also being very efficient. A bar service with nuts was delivered soon after take off along with the menu for the flight. All of the cold parts of the meal and the drinks were excellent, sadly the chicken main was quite overcooked leading to dry chicken and soggy veg. That being said it tasted very nice. Arriving into Gatwick was a dream, especially for a large airport. Although the buildings are quite old and not laid out as well as newer ones, they have done a fantastic job at modernising it and making security very quick. It took a little while for bags to reach the belt but priority bags all came out first so the process was fairly painless. I got a good deal on the flight so I would say it was reasonably good value for money, although the experience in Faro airport does reduce the premium feel considerably.",A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Faro to Gatwick,01/10/2017,yes,Verified,2,4,5,4,2,3,-1

There was no apple juice or tomato juice on the dinner trolley and the cabin crew didn't bother to fetch any. Tea served with breakfast was luke warm and stewed. No refreshments supplied unless collected from the galley It took 2 days to get through to customer relations, many calls cutting off after 18 minutes +, others cancelled after going through options. I cannot recommend British Airways who in my case certainly did not fly to serve. The experience was far below expectations and definitely at the lower budget range for customer service.

Was looking forward to eventually flying with British Airways after flying reguarly to Bangkok with other airlines - how disappointed I was. A low budget product with a premium price. I will never again use this airline, its the most costly option (usually) for my regular journey to Thailand, but it ranks the lowest of all the airlines I've used on this route in past 30 trips. Seatback screen so small and of poor quality, service is dreadful, seats are old with no powerpoints, no wifi on board. Best part of the trip was getting off. Absolutely shameful for a national carrier of the UK. Lower your costs BA as you really are budget - go fly with any of the Gulf airlines or a vast majority of Europe's best, BA are nowhere near good enough.

New lounge in South Terminal is spacious and food and beverages up to the usual good quality, although sadly, the reduction towards a cheap airline is showing in the cracks.

depths to which BA have descended,4 reviews,17/10/2017,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Orlando return. Worst ever long-haul Business Class flight.  We have experienced many airlines and many different classes of travel over the years but this most recent flight highlights the depths to which British Airways have descended (not the world’s favourite airline by far). We have never liked BA’s Business Class (Club World) seats since they changed over to the Yin-Yang layout of 8 seats across the cabin. The seat layout together with the poor service, meant we can honestly say this was the worst ever long-haul Business Class flight we have experienced. To this day I have never understood how from a health and safety viewpoint the CAA regulators ever allowed this seat configuration in the first place. Unless you are sat in an aisle seat, cabin crew have to reach over other passengers to pass hot drinks/meals which is just ridiculous. (True this happens in other seat classes as well but usually at a less precarious angle and generally not from behind your head!) In order to get out of the centre seats (rows E and F) and the window seats you have to climb over another passenger’s feet if they have their foot rest down and seat reclined. In the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous; as a minimum you normally end up kicking the passenger you are climbing over. We are both able bodied but anybody less mobile would really struggle to get out into the aisle for whatever reason. You almost feel imprisoned in the centre seats and you are often also ignored because the cabin crew just pass by quickly, often from behind you so by the time you notice them, they have gone. We should not have to use a call button just to get basic service. The return leg was a night flight, the service overall was very poor, the crew just wanted to turn the lights down ASAP. The service at breakfast was also poor, the offerings were inconsistent. My wife struggled just to get an orange juice on her side of the cabin, whereas I at least got that but struggled to get a second cup of coffee. The entertainment system was archaic (very few recent film titles), the small screen resolution was very poor; this aircraft was delivered to BA in March 1999 and it shows its age. This flight might have been a few hundred pounds cheaper than competitors but in future we will pay the extra to get a decent seat and service. BA are only getting away with retaining these dreadful seats versus aisle access for everybody because the corporate passenger market is letting them. It is obvious if your employer is paying and says you can either choose to have an economy seat or one of those dreadful business class seats, you will obviously choose the business class seat and put up with the difficulties and poor service. It will be marginally better than being seated at the back; but that does not make it right. We will probably never fly BA long-haul business class (Club World) again while we are paying for the tickets unless they stop being so arrogant and re-configure their seating!",Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Gatwick to Orlando,01/09/2017,no,Verified,10,3,2,4,3,3,2
Overall a good flight,8 reviews,15/10/2017,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Faro. Pretty good flight all round, and as ticket was bought in sale with car hire as well, it worked out good value. Check in area at south terminal is very nice and I was checked in very quickly, with fast track security equally quick. The new BA lounge is really well decorated and laid out with lots of nice and varied seating, interesting light fixtures and good views of the tarmac. It was early morning and breakfast was served, which was reasonably good. Although the hot options were just bacon roll, omelette roll or porridge which felt quite limited. Staff were all excellent. Boarding was quick, cabin crew friendly although no pre flight drink at all offered. This was an older aircraft with the old style seating, but the aircraft was clean and didn’t show much sign of age. The seats are comfortable enough, although legroom is not amazing. I was lucky enough to be in the front row so had more than most. The cooked breakfast was actually fairly good I think, nothing world shattering but decently cooked and fairly good quality ingredients. Disembarkation was quick enough, although bags took quite a while. Priority baggage didn’t seem to count for a lot, and annoyingly my priority bag tag had come off and ended up being one of the last bags.

They were totally unsympathetic and provided a chaotic service throughout the flight. The catering service was absymal, no choice of hot meal; hardly a bar service and no tea/coffee - I suspect although the aircraft arrived empty from LGW, they hadn't fully loaded the food & drinks trolleys.

shocked me with the budget low cost style,K Robinson,08/10/2017,New Zealand,"   Flew Leeds Bradford to Geneva via London Heathrow. British Airways certainly shocked me with the budget low cost style. My bag was 23.1 kg (0.1kg over the limit). This meant I had to pay for two bags whilst only having one. When I asked to take one item out and put it in my carry on to avoid paying an extra £25 or so, the answer was no, which was odd considering the bag was on the belt right infront of me. On board the aircraft boarding was prompt, a clean sleek cabin. I was seated near the back close to the toilet, which wasn't a problem. Beverage service was okay, everything was over priced, I bought a ginger ale for £2 and it was a cup, which shocked me as it was advertised as a full size can. The only thing that was free on board was water, for an international service on quite an expensive ticket it was a little disappointing. The crew were friendly and helpful but I couldn't help but overhear the crews conversation in the galley on descent into Switzerland.

Firstly, staring in the face of my two new best friends (seats facing forward) was at best weird, and at worst like a business class speed dating experience. Crew could barely serve me, ventilation was restricted and access 100% blocked by the foot rests of forward facing passengers. Once the security screens went up I felt like I was in some sort of flying crypt and was tempted to assume brace position to give the impression I had died and was on a viewing.

Galleries South in T5 is large, airy and well equipped and clean and was not too busy on the Sunday I travelled. Drinks are well stocked but from the catering it is evident this is an airline scraping to do the bare minimum in what it offers - the quality lacking with minuscule portions for breakfast and loading up of cheap carbs and curtailing of premium ingredients. Onboard it is similarly tired, the plane had not been cleaned and my seat had food debris from the previous flight and stains on the tray table. Seating is cramped. The cabin crew look dejected and have low morale. Onboard experience the service is no different, than flying easyJet, in fact I would argue worse. There is no complimentary catering, you are subjected to M&S sandwiches. It is not cheap and or good value or any better than LCC offerings. Service is slow and took the whole of 4.5 hours of the flight - meaning difficulty to going to the toilet due to the trolley blocking the aisle - I was even asked to wait until I was finished which is ludicrous given it took the whole flight to serve people. The slow service is due to the use of card only payment, and also the fact the supplier doesn't allow their chilled items to be on the trolley which means the ridiculous scenario of cabin crew constantly running to the galley to fetch items and further slowing it down. On the return journey its clear BA doesn't care about its European or non-North American routes - the lounge was a contract lounge which was very subpar, in fact it was dark dingy and furniture filthy, but least the food was decent. Overall if it wasn't for the fact I flew with FF miles and the low tax on redemptions within Europe, I would never actually pay the full cash fare for this airline - you get better more efficient service on the likes of EasyJet now within Europe with no difference in overall product now complimentary catering has been removed.",A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Istanbul,01/08/2017,no,Verified,1,2,1,1,2,1,-1
no further decline in service,Mike Palmer,01/10/2017,Canada,"  Toronto to London in Premium Economy and onto Oslo in Economy. Easy check in and in the lounge within 15 mins. The usual selection of dry sandwiches, and a chicken noodle soup (minus the chicken and noodle). The lounge was clean with plenty of staff clearing away. Efficient boarding with sparking wine/soft drinks offered. Early departure, fast drink service and dinner before lights out. There was no breakfast (previously scrapped) with the cereal bar now also gone. Early arrival, a short wait for a shower in the North Lounge, followed by an ok breakfast. An early departure and an average flight on a A319. Long queues for the bathroom (only one now for all of economy as the other was removed to provide 2 more seats) with slow buy on board service though at least they made it to the last row mainly down to little take up of food or drink. Early arrival though a long wait for bags. Oslo to London on a A320 was verging on a farce, A full flight, selfish use of the overheads delayed departure whilst crew looked for space. The buy onboard came out quickly with one and then the second handheld machine dying at the first row served. Service ground to a halt whilst the crew tried to get either machine back into life, broke out the paper visa slips, took the cart back in, re-appeared 20 mins later so service started an hour into the flight. Little take up as people had given up including me as there was little time left to enjoy the purchases. The crew tried really hard, put a brave face on and kept going. The organisation and concept of the BA buy on board is a disgrace. Though a third party provides the food and card machines, the choice, stock holding and the reliability of payment machines means the service is a farce.  I don't understand why BA continue to struggle with this service as Easyjet, Ryanair and low cost carriers seem to have have to cracked it and got their act together. Early arrival and fast bags completed the flight. Final flight home to Toronto was good, the club lounge at the B gates remains quiet, clean and an oasis to relax and eat/drink before flying. The 787 was towed to the gate 45 mins before departure and was never going to leave on time. At the gate, the experience was enhanced with an upgrade to business class. Service was really slow on boarding I had to ask for champagne, and the underwhelming bag of toiletries and shades only offered after take off. We pushed back over 30 late. No signs of life from crew for another 30 mins, though a positive enhancement was tray service for drinks which felt more classy than a cart. The main of steak was excellent and looked to be on new crockery and plated after cooking (no dried gravy or potato around the edges). Afternoon tea remains underwhelming with no scones and only three sandwiches still wrapped in plastic. Overall, the decline in service seems to have stopped with some minor improvements. The crew on all four flights were pleasant but lacking confidence and experience. The desire to do things by the book results in slow and wooden service at times. Other than the farce of buy on board, I was pleased there appeared to be no further decline in service.",Boeing 777-200 / 787-9 / A319/ 320,Business,Premium Economy,Toronto to Oslo via London,01/09/2017,yes,Verified,5,1,3,1,4,4,3
a service of 2 halves,Alistair Wharton,29/09/2017,United Kingdom,"  A return British Airways flight from London to Sofia was a service of 2 halves. The outboard leg was very good from London to Bulgaria, the check in was swift and efficient, boarding the flight was simple and quick. The 2 bag on the flight policy was enforced and stowing bags on the plane was quick. Disembarking off the plane was straight forward and easy. The flight was worth a good 8 out of 10. The return flight from Sofia to London was the opposite. Check in was slow and not inefficient. There was no priority boarding of the plane and it was a Ryanair type of scramble to board the plane. The 2 bag on the flight policy was not enforced so many people got on the flight with a roller bag, a rucksack and then a small holdall! The 5 cabin crew had a nightmare experience trying to stow all the bags before take off. Once airborne the M&S service was sold out before halve of the economy cabin was served. With only drinks and crisps available towards the end. Finally disembarking the plane was a slow and drawn out affair as passengers where trying to locate their 3 bags while holding up the isle. Overall I would give this leg 4 out of 10.",A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Sofia,01/09/2017,yes,Verified,5,3,5,2,3,3,-1
was a good experience,2 reviews,26/09/2017,Romania,"  Port of Spain to Gatwick via St. Lucia was a good experience. I don't have any complaints regarding the seat quality or flight attendants, who did a very good job during the flight on keeping the passengers safe and serving meals and drinks. The seat was comfortable enough, a bit wider than on low cost flights, I had extra space and as I noticed the leg room between seats was regular. I had a seat behind the bulkhead with enough leg room. There was a minor issue, the flight had a stop at St. Lucia, after which the new flight attendants insisted on waking up the people on the front row, opened their entertainment system screens, to show them the safety video which was shown about an hour and a half on take off from Port of Spain. I told them it's not necessary to view the video again and actually the video was not available this time, so this would be something the management should look into. In-flight entertainment was good, with no advertising, which pleased me a lot. I had a jolly passenger next to me in the middle seat, who had a bit too much to drink and moved a lot in the seat, sometimes talked louder than necessary, but he was still fun to have around and the flight attendants made sure in a very polite and funny way that he does not disturb the other passengers. There were minor issues during check-in at the departure airport in Port of Spain, the BA staff forgot to put a priority tag on my bag and give me a voucher for the lounge as I have a gold card on Oneworld. To use the lounge I had to use my Priority Pass not to waste time until the matter was cleared with the ground staff. I was flying further from Gatwick to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines, hoping I would not have to change airports in London and as a result go through immigration, take the baggage out, check-in again, pass immigration and security again, but BA doesn't have an agreement with Turkish Airlines and I had to go through this lengthy process.",Boeing 777,Business,Economy Class,Port of Spain to Gatwick via St. Lucia,01/09/2017,yes,Verified,6,5,5,5,4,4,5
Simply appalling,Douglas Day,26/09/2017,United Kingdom,"  Flew London Heathrow to Chicago. Simply appalling. Aircraft was old configuration B-747-400 with Premium Economy adjacent to First Class. Cabin was filthy, and carpets coming up. Food was inedible. The IFE system was old, slow, and low resolution. No wireless of course, either. British Airways senior executives should be forced to endure this awful service, and sample it themselves. For them to call it ""First Class"" is insulting, demeaning, and arrogant in the extreme. These old aircraft need to be replaced with the lovely A380, and the entire First Class and Club Class product should be reviewed / enhanced.

on a par with low cost carriers,T Mallon,26/09/2017,United Kingdom,"  Jersey to Gatwick. Flight left on time and the plane was clean and modern. The crew were friendly. The flight was only 40 minutes and the crew worked hard to try and serve everyone who wanted to buy food or drinks but I’m not sure they made it to the final rows. I think the problem is that there are only 2 staff to service the economy cabin whereas on our EasyJet flight out there had been 4 staff (as there is no business class). I still don’t think the buy on board is working that well, but that is not the crew’s fault. We were pleased to arrive 20 minutes early although it was a shame to have to get a bus to the terminal.

"clean plane, punctual service, pleasant cabin crew",B Morrison,21/09/2017,United Kingdom,"  I flew from London Heathrow to Sofia and back. The plane on both flights was an Airbus 321 and I’d guess a young one judging by the freshness of the interior. I am 1.82m (6 feet) tall and found the leg room and seat width to be fine – I certainly didn’t feel cramped even in the centre seat. Both flights departed the gate on schedule (although actual take-off on the outbound flight was slightly delayed because of air traffic restrictions over Europe). The cabin crew on both legs were pleasant and courteous. On both flights, the captain kept us very well informed of our route and our progress. So far, top marks to British Airways but where they let themselves down is the shambles of a refreshment service. It might seem like a minor gripe but I do like the opportunity to get something to eat or drink on a flight even if I have to pay for it (which you do not on other legacy airlines like Lufthansa). The range and prices of food and drink on offer were comparable with low cost airlines I have flown with. But there the comparison ends because whilst I have always been served quickly (and sometimes twice) on short haul low-cost airlines, BA’s service is too slow and seems to run out of stock too. They also insist on card only transactions. I had the misfortune to be sitting toward the rear of the plane on both legs - and the A321 is a long plane. A single trolley started from the front, making ponderous progress towards me and even though the flight was two hours and forty minutes long, I only just managed to get a coffee and sandwich from a slightly harried flight attendant who by now had returned the trolley and was scuttling to and from the galley, squeezing past the long queue of passengers waiting for the lavatories. (The coffee, by the way, was excellent). The return flight was worse because the trolley made it two thirds down the aisle and was getting tantalisingly close to me before abruptly stopping and returning to the galley, leaving the remaining passengers unserved. In conclusion, clean plane, punctual service, pleasant cabin crew but awful refreshment service.",A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Sofia,01/09/2017,yes,Verified,3,4,4,1,3,3,-1
service is similar to Eurowings,A Wharton,19/09/2017,United Kingdom,"  Heathrow to Bilbao. Boarding of the flight at Heathrow was very good , the flight was on time and the plane was clean. Frequent flyers boarded first and the rest soon followed. From then on the service was very similar to a Easy Jet or Eurowings flight. The 3 crew member's in economy passed through the cabin selling M&S sandwiches , snacks and coffee. The flight out of Bilbao was delayed by a late incoming aircraft, information on the delay was a little slow in coming from the gate agent. However the crew were very efficient loading the flight when it finally landed. The flight crew also managed to shave 15 minutes off the flight time too. However the service onboard is similar to Eurowings. Both flights were safe and competent. But the actual flight experience was lacking and in future I will consider Easyjet or similar as they offer the same level of service for less money.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Heathrow to Bilbao,01/09/2017,no,Verified,4,3,2,-1,4,3,-1

Lacto-ovo vegetarian special included the same tomato and mozzarella starter as on the outbound flight despite a beetroot carpaccio dish being available on the standard menu. The special main was yet again a bland, overcooked pasta dish. Overall, a pathetic vegetarian offering. Cabin crew did the bare minimum in Club Europe and their main priority seemed to be selling the M&S stuff in economy, which they were doing up until 30 minutes from landing.

Departing Abuja on return trip I had an aisle seat, again narrow and extremely uncomfortable. Old aircraft. Cost cutting squeeze in Economy will drive customers away as comparable airlines offer much more. Now the number and particularly the dimensions of the toilets have been reduced you can hardly fit into the toilet. Food on return trip was a so called breakfast, yellow mass called an omelette and some sort of potato fritter.

Meal standards are very poor compared to Lufthansa and ANA that I flew earlier this year, reflects the BA move to being budget standard airline at premium prices.

The Premium economy cabin looks clean and smart but the seat is pretty hard and not so comfortable for a long night flight. Entertainment screen very slow to respond (happened to me to with another A380 from BA so means it's an issue with the hardware).

airline is clearly failing fast,C Rankin,12/09/2017,United States,  Dubai to London. I am a regular BA flyer and so generally my expectation is low nowadays as they almost become a Tier 2 airline. The journey started in the Concorde lounge Dubai and it is a very small area with little food that in the two hours I was there was not refreshed. Onboard the 777 you begin to sense the jobs worth attitude of the staff who seem to permanently work to rule. Amazingly when the menu came it contained only an Arabic snack with no options. They say this is to allow maximum sleep. No other airline has done this. Breakfast was undercooked slop and it was inedible. It is incredible that you can spend 10000 usd on a ticket and you can't even get a meal. The airline is clearly failing fast and I wish now I had flown the luxury of Emirates at half the price.

they are just an embarrassment,1 reviews,11/09/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Gatwick to Funchal. In my opinion British Airways have got things badly wrong in the race to the bottom. For travellers in Economy BA are now just another budget carrier and not a very good one at that. They have failed to understand what their true market is all about. Generally if people want to use a cheap budget carrier they will use the likes of Ryanair or Easyjet. The BA brand has always been associated with the quality that a full service airline provides, but sadly not any more. The choice of food for sale to the economy passenger is not only poor but it's expensive. Frankly it must be embarrassing for the cabin crew to make announcements saying that the business class passengers will be offered a hot meal and free drinks but all those in economy must pay. And that assumes that from the enormous range of 2 types of sandwich on offer that there will be any left. On our flights to and from Funchal there was a single trolley for the entire economy cabin, in each case taking more than 2 hours to make it from the front to the back. Service could only have been any slower if the crew were trying to sell scratch cards along with the overpriced food and drink! Maybe that's in the next part of the BA master plan?! British Airways used to be a national carrier to be proud of but these days they are just an embarrassment, not a full service airline or a decent budget carrier, simply lost somewhere in the middle. As a fairly regular traveller of many years my preference would always been to travel with my national airline but this race to the bottom is driving me away. Don't BA management understand that there are many people who would gladly pay a little bit more for 'free' food and drink? Sadly I think we know the answer. All we need now is a bugle playing as the plane touches down and the sad transition from world class carrier to poor budget imitator will be complete.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Gatwick to Funchal,01/09/2017,no,Verified,1,1,1,1,2,1,-1
very good flight again,John Barry,09/09/2017,United Kingdom,"  Zakinthos to London Heathrow. Poor check in at Zante airport. Not enough desks, slightly clueless staff.

Again the crew were really good about helping my nervous wife with the female co-pilot coming out to chat. Not left wanting the whole flight. A bug bear on both flights were the economy passengers using the club toilet at will. This kept disrupting the cabin service and made my little one nearly have a problem because of the extra queues.

Champagne was available on request. Due to a flight delay our plane did not depart from the air bridge, but at gate 6, but we could access this gate using stairs from the lounge, this was managed well as we were given priority boarding before general boarding was announced in the main terminal. The flight was probably at 30% capacity so the FA had no problems serving passengers. The flight was delayed by 30 minutes but we made some time and was at the gate at Heathrow 20 minutes late.

Aside from take-off and morning meal service privacy screen never came down between me and fellow traveler.

wonderful member of crew,H Cole,06/09/2017,United Kingdom,"  London to Vancouver. I booked our trip with them as the price was unbeatable. Our outward flight to Vancouver was delayed by approx an hour. We were seated on the top deck and I was impressed by the room we had (window/Aisle and 3 middle seats). The crew were great with our young sons offering them extra drinks, pillows etc. Food was OK (the kids Mac cheese was better than the adult meals). Entertainment was good and flight was smooth most of the way. On our return flight we again had a delay of about an hour but 45 mins of that was made up thanks to a strong tail wind. Again we were on the top deck and it was so quiet up there it was lovely. Food was again just ok. We had an incident where my son spilt a bottle of Fanta all over himself midflight when everyone was asleep. He was drenched and I had no spare clothes for him. I spoke to a wonderful member of crew who couldn't be more helpful. She found some first class PJs for him to change into and gave him a couple of extra goodies and she checked up on us a few times after that commenting how good he had been throughout the flight.

exceptionally ordinary flight,2 reviews,06/09/2017,United Kingdom,"  London to Sao Paulo. An exceptionally ordinary flight, both for good and for bad. Cabin crew were disinterested -- I was made to feel intrusive when I asked at the galley for a glass of water between dinner and breakfast service -- something I'd never felt before. I felt somewhat snubbed when, after asking for help (being short) loading my (exit-row) hand luggage into the OHLs the FA took heed of an older woman telling him her bag had ""two tablets in and is fragile"" so should be stacked on top of mine, and didn't bother to ask me about the contents of my bag -- my laptop speakers haven't worked since. I slept through dinner service, but was awake for the standard disappointment of a breakfast. A continental/charcuterie option would go down a treat on this route, I imagine, but we had a choice of flaccid English breakfast or flaccid omelette.

not recommended at all,1 reviews,06/09/2017,United Kingdom,"  On a flight from Bangkok to London and you'll have some locals and holiday makers that wish to have a taste of Thailand in their meal choices. First meal service has Thai Green Curry (veg) and the second Thai Red Curry (chicken). Really? No one could come up with two Thai dishes that were a little bit more different? So the meal service begins and I was going to have the chicken satay starter and main course salad with grilled prawns. Unfortunately the chicken satay dish has been replaced by a prawn dish which turns out to be every ingredient from the chicken satay apart from the chicken and obviously with prawns.  I said, ""I don't want the prawns for starter as I'm having the prawn main meal."" I should not have worried as the prawn salad was off.  Ok so prawns for starter and I'll have garlic herb crusted chicken breast with onion sauce, mashed potatoes, mushroom, spinach and tomato. Well I'm not sure how they did it but the potatoes were disgusting to the point I wasn't eating them. The chicken breast was dry and I got no hint of herb or garlic or chicken to be honest and the onion sauce could not save it even if there had been enough of it. Mushrooms were very meh, tomato and spinach were fine but all in all inedible. The bread roll didn't win any prizes either. I just gave up and refused to eat it. Now when this was served I'd been drinking rose champagne and wanted a glass of chardonnay but the FA was off too quickly. No problem, press the call bell. Which is reset before anyone comes. Press it again and think I'd better get on with eating my food. Eventually some one arrives and notices I'm not eating my main course and after I tell them it is disgusting I ask why no one has answered my call button. Obviously I'm just asked what did I want and I say it was the wine but it is a bit too late now and I'll have port instead as cheese and crackers will be my next choice. This does not appear for fifteen minutes. During that time I am offered the vegetable thai green curry to replace my inedible main but that isn't going work for me. So a couple of hours later I'm a bit peckish and go to raid the club kitchen where I find some quite pleasant snacks. Back at my seat I think I need a G&T with this but ten minutes later no one has arrived or even been in our cabin. There is no one in the galley galley between the two club world cabins and indeed no member of staff in the larger CW cabin. I do find one in the second galley. I ask and my call button is tested and appears to be working but three times I've tried to use it and been ignored. Bad service. Now on to the second meal service. Strangely there appears to be no choice unlike stated in the menu. I ask the FA about this but am just told everyone is having the same, no explanation. The starter turns out to be smoked salmon with a wasabi dressing. The dressing is tasteless but salmon is fine. Now this is a pity because my choice of main was going to be a meze that had smoked salmon as a major part and now I have to choose again. Ok main meal, I'm give a choice of smoked salmon again or red Thai curry so no choice really and I decide to give up and go to a restaurant when I disembark.

significant downgrade in BA service,E Lanson,04/09/2017,United Kingdom,"  Having flown First Class from London to Cape Town and Club back from Johannesburg I have really noticed a significant downgrade in BA service and standards compared to premium flights I have taken in previous years. The seats in First had crumbs on them on arrival, in Club there was sticky stuff on the arm rest which hadn't been cleaned. On the return Club flight in particular, the purser told us on the tannoy that staffing levels were low so service would be slower; on 3 occasions I had to ask for a G&T, eventually I only received it by going to the galley. It was made clear by the staff that they resented my interrupting their jokes and conversation. Food in club was average. First lounge in T3 not great: sole Elemis spa person decided to take an hour off from 1840-1940 (leaving a scribbled paper sign saying ""back in an hour"") which wasn't helpful given several long haul flights were leaving at 9pm. When I tried to book an appointment on her return, she told me she was busy and full (whilst checking Facebook on her iPhone). In terms of hard product, the Club seat just doesn't compare with rivals any more: it's way too narrow and storage space is dire. These flights were 'miles burn', I won't be accruing more avios with BA.",Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Cape Town,01/08/2017,no,Verified,9,2,2,2,1,2,1
get your act together,25 reviews,02/09/2017,United Kingdom,"  London to Milan. Having read about BA's cut backs on service, I approached my flight with slight trepidation. I was not too disappointed though. The flights were smooth and left on time, seating fairly comfortable, consider is was a 80 minute flight. Pre-board and on board announcements were efficient and informative. The downside however, was the in flight food and drinks service which was in disarray. Although BA on European routes have also opted for charging for virtually everything that low cost carriers do, I still expected some efficiency. It was tediously slow, with the attendants pacing up and down the isles to get an item not in the trolley. The glossy M&S menu looked good, but too laborious to get some food and pay for it. With some families split up, paying for items took longer, with some getting impatient and noisy. By the time the trolley reached the back of the aircraft, the descent had already begun. It is a shame that our national carrier while giving the illusion of a quality airline, is anything but. Come on BA, get your act together, or at least like a quote I once read, ""we are like British Rail love, we may be late, but we're getting there"".",A319,Business,Economy Class,London to Milan,01/08/2017,yes,Verified,7,3,1,1,3,2,-1
seating rough around the edges,A Wharton,31/08/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Bucharest. A full flight both ways to Bucharest using a A321. Boarding in London was efficient and orderly. The boarding in Bucharest was more akin to a rugby scrum! Any sense of control by BA went out of the window. The plane was clean, but the interior was tired and the seating rough around the edges. There was no USB ports or entertainment which makes for a long 3 hours. The M&S meal service worked well flying out of London, but less so returning. Food Inventory must have been limited on departure as must products quickly sold out. Leaving a selection of drinks and crisps! Also the BA cabin crew are still learning how to take payments quickly and efficiently, which slows the process down too.",A321,Business,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Bucharest,01/08/2017,no,Verified,1,2,4,2,3,2,1
downgraded so drastically,T Merton,31/08/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Bologna. I have given a decent score overall as both of our flights were on time and got us and our luggage safely from A to B for a competitive price. The planes were clean and modern. However like many I do feel sad that the service on BA has been downgraded so drastically. The buy on board scheme is a bit chaotic and on the flight out the trolley only reached us about 15mins before landing. It’s hard to say it is so slow, other airlines are much more efficient. The crew were very pleasant but there is limited chance for interaction as the buy on board takes most of the flight. I thought it was quite poor that no announcements or communications were made on either journey in Italian. To be honest there was nothing to distinguish this flight from those I have taken with EasyJet, so now will make my decision purely based on price rather than any loyalty to a particular airline.",A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Bologna,01/08/2017,no,Verified,5,4,4,2,4,4,1

The meals served was very good with a simple starter, decent hot main course and tasty dessert. There was endless drinks and hot drinks available during the flight.

Had this have been a one off then I wouldn't mind so much but this is the third time in 6 months. I have called BA and even emailed social media team, even at the airport I tried to rectify the situation but no one interested or even prepared to tell me why.

I flew JAL on the way out and the service was superb and meals delicious. On my return I felt embarrassed that BA is our national airline, mainly due to the absolutely abysmal meal quality. White fish consisted of 3 tiny pieces of 'fish' surrounded by a brown, fatty unidentifiable, flavourless mass. The tiny token broccoli was a greenish brown mush. Service was efficient, bordering on perfunctory. Luckily we brought some other food on board.

flight was pretty regular,3 reviews,24/08/2017,United Kingdom,"  Amsterdam to Gatwick. Check in was easy thanks to fast help from the check-in desk. The staff at the gate were friendly and ensured boarding did not take a huge amount of time. The welcome on board was exceptional, however the cabin crew service was quite regular for the remainder of the flight (ie, nothing exceptional or poor). The seats looked very appealing, but the seams at the point where the upright and horizontal parts of the seat meet are out of line and make it slightly uncomfortable to sit on after a while. This is a great shame for a good looking cabin. We took off twenty minutes after the intended time, due to a late start to boarding and an extended taxi time. However, the pilots did a great job in keeping us informed to the reason for the delay, and the current progress in making up the lost time. Overall the flight was pretty regular from BA, but the good ground staff, useful information as of the delay and friendly cabin crew, made it a good service.",A320-233,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Gatwick,01/08/2017,yes,Verified,4,3,4,-1,4,4,-1
A huge disappointment,C Berlin,22/08/2017,United States,"  New York to Cape Town via London Heathrow. A huge disappointment. Even worse when you put it in context of what British Airways used to be. We decided to fly First  because I can't stand Club world (backward seats, forward facing seats almost on the aisle),  claustrophic, poor overhead storage on some planes. Seats were  narrow, poor seat controls (unable to independently control the different seat axes, foot rest had to be set manually), American Airlines and Cathay Pacific new business class products are far better than BA first class. AVOD great on one leg with the new Pansonic system, dreadful on the 2nd leg with the old system.  Food was mediocre at best.

A national disgrace,Harsha Kariyawasam,20/08/2017,United Kingdom,"  Salzburg to Gatwick. Awful experience. Flight delayed due to operational reasons but this is forgiven as these things happen and BA handling in Salzburg did apologise for the delay. Once boarded with a full flight there were 4 crew members, 2 to serve Club with about 8 passengers and 2 to serve about 120 or more economy passengers. Usual fight for bag space. I was desperate for some water and asked the crew can I buy some water as they dragged the trolley to the front of the cabin. I am in seat 23C right at the back. I am told no, I have to wait for the trolley. I wait and wait and as we fasten our seat belts on descent to Gatwick the trolley gets to seat row 20. The 2 members of crew are still struggling to take card payments, and tell row 20 that the service is now closed, and pass the trolley back to the behind galley. All this as the CSD stands chatting in the Club galley with the other crew member. 1/4 of cabin not given the chance to even buy a glass of water in a 2 hour dinner time flight. No smiles from crew as busy doing math on what they are selling. Not even a flight map to help pass time. Terrible airline. A national disgrace, worse than any budget carrier with high prices and terrible customer service.

Another miserable experience,C Porter,19/08/2017,United Kingdom,"  Athens to Newcastle via London. Another miserable experience. Woken at 7am by text to say 13.30 flight to Heathrow cancelled for operational reasons - phone numbers listed to rearrange. One not open till 9am GMT, the Greek one no longer in use. Website also useless: 'We are experiencing technical difficulties - try again later.' 2 stressful hours later managed to get rebooked onto much later flights - but downgraded on both sectors. [Still not happy that I was involuntarily downgraded on my last BA flight at Easter!] Athens used to have a great BA lounge. Now it's provided by someone else for varied airlines and was pretty grim. Partly because it was filled with numerous disgruntled passengers also downgraded from the cancelled flight. Flights adequate but no different really to service of any budget airline. Crew apologetic about situation but clearly feel they have no voice in BA's direction. Athens ground staff were superb in dealing with unhappy people - albeit unable to say much other than to apologise and say make sure you complain / claim. BA are lucky to have such brilliant front of house staff and cabin crew - without them I'd have already deserted. Still waiting for any response from airline re EU compensation / downgrade almost 2 weeks after submitting forms / emails. This could surely be automatic [managed by most US airlines] and contrasts with a recent Air France experience of far more trivial nature where within 24 hours I'd received a voucher and a personal apology.",A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Athens to Newcastle via London,01/08/2017,no,Verified,7,2,5,1,5,2,-1

It is with regret that I have to admit that I have booked our next longhaul business class flight with another provider. BA will not retain their premium clients if they continue with their current model, I am sure that those who use point etc will remain loyal.

cabin crew fell below the standard,B Rawlins,17/08/2017,United Kingdom,"  London City to Dusseldorf return, flights operated on behalf of BA by Eastern Airways. The cabin was clean on both aircraft and the check in and wait at the both the airports were reasonable however then the good part of the trip ceases. Cabin Crew must of been members of the Basil Fawlty school of Catering. The outward flight there were 3 passengers in the business class cabin and the onboard menu was handed out to the three of us. The young stewardess took our orders, then we heard a crash as the young stewardess promptly dropped one of the meal and told us that the aircraft only had two meals and asked for a volunteer to give up their meal. The meal was of a reasonable quality and well presented. On arrival at Dusseldorf the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were taken by bus to the wrong terminal. The arrivals boards in the airport say terminal B and we were dropped off at Terminal C. Our delivered to terminal C and we had to walk to Terminal B if you were been met. The return flight was another example of the sub standard ground handling agents that BA is becoming famous for at overseas airports. Check in did not open until 90 minutes before the fight to LCY and 2 hours before the flight to LHR. I can see that this was a money saving wiz by the ground handling agents at Dusseldorf. As the flight to LCY may only have max 100 pax and they would of been able to see the flight loading the day before. The check in staff were reasonable and two were very smart only to be let down by the young female on Club Europe who was tattooed and had a slightly outlandish hairstyle. Which looked totally out of place in uniform. The flight again seemed to have catering problems in business class with 6 pax and only 3 meals, which meant that 3 passengers were offered a so called Ham & Chasse croissant which looked if it had seen better days. Again the cabin crew fell below the standard expect on budget airlines such has Wizz and Ryanair, in fact they have better staff than Eastern Airways so these crews maybe the one who have failed these airlines selection process.  I was disgusted with the lack of professionism and customer service skills these crews displayed. On arrival at LCY it become apparent that the ground handling agents at Dusseldorf had failed to load all the bags for the flight and left somewhere in the region of 8 passengers case behind. The handling agents at LCY could not be bothered to take a proactive approach to ensure the bags followed on the next flight. I did phone on Monday evening and a gave more details of the contents of the case to them which they did update on the system. This morning I spoke to a member of senior management at Dussledorf Airport. About 4 hours after this call the bags had been found in the baggage handling area at the airport. They will be put on the late flight tonight which means I will get it nearly 4 days after it became missed.

they are now a junk airline,E Hanner,07/08/2017,United Kingdom,"  Nice to London Heathrow. I had to fly to Nice and back for work. Booked through the Company travel Agency. Extra bag added both ways. I wanted to fly back to LHR earlier so my Travel Agent rebooked the earlier flight at a cost of 371 GBP. When I arrived at NCE the Ground Staff refused to acknowledge the extra bag, saying that it was for the earlier flight. I stood my ground, but the Head of Check in told me if I wanted to fly I had to pay 75 EUR which I did under duress. I had prebooked my seat as Silver to find out at the gate that it had been changed to a middle seat which I loathe as the 767 is claustrophobic. I asked for my bags to be offloaded and I would travel on the next flight as is my right to do so there was a standoff at the gate.  The trend for BA in their spiral to the bottom is to outsource Check in Staff who have no comprehension of the BA system, combined with an arrogant ignorance that means I will not be choosing this airline again. I have one more flight with them next week and that's it. I paid almost 1100 pounds to get to Nice and back today, in economy, I was greeted with disdain by Ground Staff, the Crew on board were utterly miserable as they get to grips with the fact that they are now a junk airline who, despite the high prices, have the audacity to charge 7 pounds for a gin and tonic.

budget airline service at best,1 reviews,03/08/2017,Canada,"  Unimpressed! Service very indifferent, impression that it's only a job by flight crew with no smiles on this flight. Perfunctory service at best! Guess this maybe all you can expect when you fly economy. British Airways calls their economy 'World Traveller', I wonder if those 'at the top' making decisions have travelled the world and are aware of the (much) superior service (most) other airlines offer even in economy? BA take a page from Qantas to see what economy service looks like. My understanding is BA recently lost a star, and are now only 3 stars. Quite understandable from what was offered on this flight! Food, awful, dinner of chicken, rice and peas. Breakfast over Ireland was a cream filled bun and granola bars, awful! Even a recent United flight from SYD to SFO served better meals! No return of crew to offer more beverages. And no service of water during the flight which most airlines constantly offer. The wine offering was the best part, a reasonably good Spanish Pinot Gris! There are alternatives to the UK from Canada, Air Canada, Air Transat, Westjet. On Westjet, you purchase your food, but I'm sure it has to be superior to BA's offering! My last flight to Britain on Air Canada was much superior. Air France last October to Paris was excellent! Qantas to Australia, is always brilliant! The only redeeming factor on this flight was the Airbus 380, still the smoothest and quietest plane flying!

In fact, I've had superior travel experiences on some budget carriers. Flying from Vancouver to London on the A380 was superb, it's a wonderful aircraft. Beyond that - atrocious. Dinner was a tough piece of chicken, over cooked vegetables and dried up rice. Breakfast was a farce, a dry bun with a smearing of cream cheese and a granola bar. Hardly suitable breakfast fare. The entertainment options were far inferior to what they used to be and the crew were unsmiling, disinterested and inattentive throughout the flight. No snacks, no water offering between meals; nothing! On the same route, Air Canada is superior in every way.

After arriving at 13:00 we were eventually taken by bus to a hotel almost 1 hour away, arriving at 24:00.

All looked good until the gate crew lost control of the gate on seeing the door to the jetway open passengers surged forward and then blocked the entrance while the calls made for First, Gold, Business etc to come forward. It is not pleasant to have to to push forward to get to the gate as a BA premium passenger. One First class passenger told the gate assistant to ""take control back of the gate"". She blamed the passengers when actually it was just poor gate management by the staff. It was a miracle then that the flight departed on time and arrived into Accra a little early. A first for me in 18 years on the route! Once on board the crew on the top deck could not have been more friendly. A shame then for them that they have such a poor product to work with - poor food, poor seats in a layout that defies any sense, lousy cheap amenity kit and finally an inflight entertainment package that does not change month after month.

I will not be using BA again,S Varinder,31/07/2017,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Orlando return. Possibly the worst pre and post flight experience I can remember. 4 hrs late on the way out, almost three hours late on the return journey. BAs use of old aircraft is to blame. A failed IFE that couldn't be repaired took two hours to try and remedy. After this failed, a replacement plane was required. By the time this arrived, BA realised their crew could not fly due to exceeding their hours. This led to a further 1hr delay waiting for a standby crew. This was avoidable and shows the lack of genuine care pre flight by BA. No refreshments provided, no accurate information, just endless waiting. They didn't board the children first and it was a total mess. The plane could not land due to bad weather and had to divert to Tampa due to low fuel. Whilst this seems fair enough, the plane was actually 1hr late leaving Gatwick in the first place so had it left on time, it might have landed fine and passengers would not have encountered as long a delay as we did.  A terrible shame and an embarrassment to be called British as it does not bring any warm or professional feelings as far as I can see. I will not be using BA again.",Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Orlando ,01/07/2017,no,Verified,10,4,3,2,1,3,3
The worst business class,B Rowden,31/07/2017,United Kingdom,"  San Diego to London Heathrow. The worst business class I have flown in! I flew on the 777 so whilst it's not the newest plane in the fleet, I still expected some level of comfort. The seats are too narrow and do not lie flat. I'm a slim size 8 and could not turn around in my seat. There is a footrest that comes down to form the end of the bed, but does not line up with the rest of the seat. So your feet are raised. The armrests are narrow and hard and wobble around. Every time the person next to you moves, your chair moves too. The hydraulics must be connected. It was very annoying. The tray table was not well supported and when pulled out of the arm rest, it sloped down and so drinks/meal tray did not stay put. It was not secure and basically, was flimsy and unusable. I had to use my inflatable neck pillow to support it on my lap. I was in seat 14A which was a rear facing window seat. There is a plastic divider between you and the seat next to you (which is a forward facing aisle seat). The divider has to stay down until you are airbourne. So for the first 40 minutes or so whilst the plane is boarding, you are staring a fellow passenger directly in the face. Very awkward! The tv pulls out of the side column and mine wouldn't stay put. It wanted to go back into the column and so I had to watch my movie at an angle. The food. Well. The fillet streak was tough and dry. I had a similar dish flying out to the states on a 777 with American Airlines and they did a much better job. The selection of wines was good and the key lime pie was nice. Service: if you want good service, don't get a window seat. You are cut off from the aisle, and with the plastic divider up between you and the opposite passenger, the cabin crew forget you are even there. I had to ask for a drink when the trolley went round, both with dinner and breakfast. The layout of the seats also makes it tricky for the cabin crew to pass you your drinks and food as they have go above the opposite passengers head! Not ideal with some turbulence. There was also no wifi even though BA advertise as such. Apparently the Boeing 777 does not have the right equipment. In short, BA have obviously prioritised cramming as many small seats as possible into business class cabin. The layout is impractical, seats are narrow, there is an awkwardness with an intimate view of the fellow passenger, and the layout also means that your not clearly visible to the cabin crew and so get ignored. The 777 is an old plane and definitely needs modernising to ensure that the seats are working properly, the TV's stay out of their sockets so you can watch a movie and the tray tables can support your meal. I for one will not be flying BA business again.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,San Diego to London,01/07/2017,no,Verified,8,1,2,2,2,1,2
cabin crew were efficient and friendly enough,Alan Wan,28/07/2017,United Kingdom,"  
Flew British Airways from Pisa to London Gatwick. The two of us arrived at the airport exactly two hours before departure. We had hand baggage only and had already checked-in online and had boarding cards on our smartphones so proceeded to security. The queue was pretty hectic and it took 30 minutes to get through. Although we were flying Economy as BA Gold members we had access to the lounge. The lounge was quite dated in design but very comfortable with a good selection of food and beverage for a contract lounge. We left the lounge 45 minutes before the scheduled departure as still had to go through passport control, the queue was long and slow and took 20 minutes to get through. Once through we headed to the gates which was boarding for priority passengers. We received the magic beep and were upgraded to Club Europe (both of us are Gold members). We were seated in row 7, it was the typical 3 seats but the middle seat blocked with a tray installed. Leg room not great but we are both short. After take off we were offered drinks. I had a glass of champagne which was served from a full size bottle. We were then offered afternoon tea, consisting of three finger sandwiches: beef, egg and tuna and a slice of Victoria sponge cake. All very tasty but I do miss the scones in Club Europe. I also managed two top ups of champagne. The cabin crew were efficient and friendly enough and happy to provide extra drinks when requested. The flight arrived on time and we were on a train within 30 minutes of landing. Overall we paid £50 each for the flight and with the upgrade was a bargain.",A319,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Pisa to London Gatwick,01/07/2017,yes,Verified,2,3,4,3,3,5,-1

Flight from Newcastle to Heathrow fine, although paying for a cup of tea with Avios was not especially slick. A superb flight from Heathrow to Boston, even though it was the day the latest BA strike started (19th July). Left slightly late due to Heathrow computer problems earlier in the day but we were kept fully informed about progress. Seats on B777-300 comfortable with plenty of legroom in the bassinet seats. Cabin crew thoughtful and highly professional and there were regular considerate, reassuring updates from the cockpit. Food really pretty good - dropping the second meal on this route is not a problem for me. Entertainment not bad at all. Had a very nice chat with the captain waiting for the bags to arrive in the airport. All BA crew were a credit to the airline and if this is the norm for BA, I would happily fly with them again soon.",Boeing 777-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newcastle to Boston via London,01/07/2017,yes,Verified,4,5,5,5,4,4,5

can't really complain about the overall experience,Alan Wan,25/07/2017,United Kingdom,"  This was a one way Avios redemption flight. Fare cost £17.50 and 7,500 Avios each. As a BA Gold member I used the First class wing at T5, this included direct access to the Galleries First lounge. We were through very quickly as there was no queue at security. The lounge was busy and we arrived at the switch over from breakfast to lunch. The former had better food offering, the sausages and mushrooms very tasty. Lunch wasn't very good, I ordered a BA burger, the chips were the best part but only five were given on the plate, my wife ordered the aranchini which was awful and tasteless - she left most of it. The buffet selection wasn't particularly interesting, some chicken, potatoes, veggie curry and chilli. My wife said the curry was okay but the chilli I tried was bland. The drinks on offer were decent, a gin festival was on, although I don't drink the stuff the choice looked extensive. I had a few glasses of Henriot champagne which was okay better than the awful Castlenau they used to have but not as good as the Taittinger they served a year ago. I tried a few sips of a Kiwi Pinot Gris, can't remember what it was called but it was very nice. Finally I couldn't resist a shot of Johnnie Walker Blue. The first class lounge itself needs some TLC, the gents are smelly and unkept and none of the plug sockets worked. I normally try to fly another Oneworld airline other than BA. But if it has to be BA then I prefer to fly from T3 for the excellent Cathay Pacific lounge. In fact I prefer the new BA Gatwick First lounge than the Galleries T5. The flight itself was okay, it pushed back slightly late and arrived at Bologna on time. I didn't bother with the BoB as had eaten in the lounge and was saving myself for dinner in Bologna. Cabin crew seemed friendly enough and spent quite a long time selling the BoB offering. We sat in a pair of two seats next to door 3L. Really appreciated just two seats without any neighbours on the almost full flight. Due to our seat position in the plane and the fact both front and rear doors were used for deplaning, we were one of the last passengers to exit. It was a short bus ride to the terminal and it took 20 minutes to get though passport control then a further 30 minute wait for our luggage. Despite a lot of moans about BA on this forum I can't really complain about the overall experience. As a Gold member the lounge access was free. But if I paid full premium fare to access the lounge then yes I'd be disappointed.",A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Bologna,01/07/2017,yes,Verified,1,3,4,3,4,5,-1
We won't be flying with BA again,P Cole,24/07/2017,United Kingdom,"  We did a return trip from Heathrow to JFK and there were only two good things about flying British Airways, you can use the entertainment system from the start and we liked Terminal Five at Heathrow. The rest was disappointing. The outbound flight was completely full so it was delayed in departing, you would expect them to have known this so they would be able to prepare and ensure that the flight left on schedule. There was no apology. The return trip was also late in departing but was quicker than expected so cannot complain. There was only one inflight meal and the only other offering was a bag of crisps or an 18g chocolate bar. It felt like being in school. Cabin crew weren't overly friendly on either journey. Inflight entertainment was fine, lots of films both new and old to watch. We would usually fly Emirates or Virgin but decided to fly BA to give it a go. If you have similar thoughts, don't do it. We won't be flying with BA again, they are not worth it.

BA cut us no slack for the injury,P Gerton,24/07/2017,United States,"  Barcelona to Boston via London. Mixed review: we had to rebook suddenly for next-day business class because my wife broke a bone in her shoulder and had to go home urgently. BA cut us no slack for the injury and the change cost a fortune. The good: flight crews were wonderfully supportive and helpful; food was surprisingly good; wheelchair attendants at LHR were wonderful. The bad: A321 business class was an economy seat with slightly increased pitch and the middle seat blocked; Boeing 777 business class seats were very comfortable, but a seat in the middle of the 4-seat central block allowed no access to the aisle if the aisle passenger had the seat flattened or was using the footrest; LHR connection of 2 hr was barely enough for terminal 3 to 5 transfer (BA representative said 1 hr would be adequate!) - even with a wheelchair that allowed priority through security and transfer bus.

endured rather than enjoyed,M Keane,22/07/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Brussels return. Through work I have to fly frequently and am firmly of the opinion that a BA flight is to be endured rather than enjoyed, even in the premium cabins. If your timing is right the prices reflect this, that is before the “add-on’s”. So be prepared to get on last, be prepared to be given the middle seat on the last or second to last row, and eat and drink before you board – unless of course you are happy to pay more. That way if you get an aisle seat or are allocated the third to last row up, it’s a win. Any flights longer than a couple of hours I strenuously avoid BA if I can - a shame because in some ways I grew up with BA (back in the days of BOAC and BEA).

very poor quality seats,11 reviews,21/07/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Accra. Flight left nearly two hours late - bit of an explanation but was really because the ground staff boarded the plane with only minimal time to departure. This is always a busy flight with passengers taking on loads of cabin bags. Ground staff only started to collect excess baggage from people with 20 mins to boarding and so there was no room on board for all luggage. Chaos in economy class. On this flight it does not work when the flight is boarded with anything less than 1 hr to departure. When will BA realise this flights needs at least 60 mins to board - it is the most delayed flight out of Heathrow because of this poor management. Fact. The ground staff did nothing to control the crowds - simple and polite requests would have helped. The grand staff were downright rude and grumpy with their passengers - on one of the money making flights for the airlines they need to up their game and just be polite (even if they do not enjoy their jobs or dealing with passengers). Once on board the crew were friendly and professional. Very friendly but this does make up for old aircraft in need of a good clean and refresh along with poor in flight entertainment, poor food and very poor quality seats. The cold/salad options are far better than the hot offering in BA's club class. Still no wi-fi on BA?

We had a delay in take off but apologies provided. Food was okay and I was pleasantly surprised. Crew members were hard working, polite and professional. The Boeing 777-200was showing signs of age (G-VIIW ) but compared to the other aircraft we flew on last year, this plane appeared more cared for. I am concerned how BA are going to shoehorn 10 abreast instead of the current 9. I cannot conceive how physically eating a meal would be possible. Overall the experience was good on this occasion.

other carriers must be laughing,11 reviews,16/07/2017,United Kingdom,"  New York JFK - London Heathrow. The British Airways lounge at JFK is truly terrible. It seems to have been refreshed of late but this means rows of scruffy seats and toilets that are too few for the crowds. Not enough chairs for the evening flights that tend to depart within a few hours of each other. I wasn’t allowed into the First Class lounge despite being a BA Gold List member. So much for loyalty. Was instructed at check in that this was a “sleeper service” and I should eat in the lounge. Not an advisory but an instruction. The Club World food on offer in the lounge for the “dining experience” was overcooked and of very poor quality. Usual Cub World service on BA which involves clambering over people to get out to the aisle, poor food (they did offer food), poor in-flight entertainment, putting the inflight divider down but never putting it back up (BA train your staff if they put the divider down to have the good manners to put it up again) to serve food and drinks. The crew obviously know they are providing an inferior product and act accordingly. The product and offer from BA is so mediocre (I even saw Club Class passengers taking their own food on for example) the other carriers must be laughing as they take over BA in terms of service and quality of aircraft.

The bench part was 5 inches different level to main seat. Extremely uncomfortable and didn't sleep a wink. No extra pillows available in either Business or First. Food inedible on both journeys. Outbound fillet of British Beef was as tough as old rope. They should be ashamed of the Business breakfast on the YYZ-LHR as I've had better in a greasy Joe's cafe. Also, the wine printed on the menu not available on both legs. A case of over-promising and under-delivering again. Simply miles behind the competition.

crew doing an excellent job,C Rankin,10/07/2017,United Kingdom,"  Return flights from Newcastle to Geneva via London Heathrow in Club Europe. Check in at Newcastle rapid without a queue. Fast track worked well. Lounge was ok, but limited selection of food. Onboard all flights, the domestic and European biz class is fine. Seats with decent legroom, choice of food (chicken salad, charcuterie and cheese) and good quality drinks. The staff were lovely, professional and good humoured despite having a lot of service to deliver on short sectors. Crew from GVA-LHR particularly good with a biz passenger who became unwell and needed medical attention on arrival. All of this during the Mixed Fleet strike dates. T5 South Lounge at LHR was like a sauna, and access impossible from south security (involves a long walk downstairs then up again). North lounge better on return, but bathrooms generally dirty and in need of an update. Tagged priority bags were literally the last on the belt at Geneva which was a joke, but likely not BA's fault. First off back in Newcastle. Overall, the short haul business product is perfectly adequate, if for nothing other than skipping queues.

see the decline in quality from BA,K Sawyer,08/07/2017,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Mauritius. Very disappointed to see the decline in quality from BA since I last flew with them. For a flight of 11.5 hours to Mauritius, I was shocked by the quality of the economy class seats and that BA seriously consider them good enough for a long haul flight of this length. Possibly the least comfortable airline seat I've ever had, with every lump and bump imaginable, and the infuriating headrest which doesn't stay up, slipping down and banging you in the neck every 15 minutes. The seat back offered no protection from the person behind putting things in their seat pocket. Legroom also very poor (albeit I am above average height) but my knees were pressed against the seat in front even before they reclined into me. The food was also poor. No snacks offered, and the meals were slop. I have flown Air NZ, Virgin, Emirates and BA in the last two years and BA was the poorest in terms of food and comfort. Good points: the cabin crew were reasonably good, toilets were clean, and the in-flight entertainment worked fine with a good selection, but that wasn't enough to save this from being a genuinely poor experience.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Mauritius,01/06/2017,no,Verified,7,1,3,1,3,3,4
declined due to cost cutting,John Keeler,07/07/2017,Spain,"  Boston to Barcelona via London. I am a silver BA card holder and reserved two flights (myself and my wife) from Boston to London Heathrow (in premium economy) and Heathrow to Barcelona in Economy class. I paid for seat reservations for my wife on both legs as she has a bronze card and cannot reserve without paying. On check in at Boston we were given different seats for the Heathrow to Barcelona sector than I had reserved (in the exit row), due to a change of aircraft configuration. Although the booking was made months before no advance notice was given of the change. In early June I applied for a refund of the seat reservation cost and  was given a case number. To date there has been no communication or refund from BA in spite of my sending a second email asking for information. Overall the service onboard and attention to customers has declined significantly over the past year due to cost cutting measures. We will not be flying transatlantic with BA in the future after 7 years of several crossings each year.

Half the entertainment did not work properly if at all. In short acceptable service. Flight left and arrived on time.

British Airways was once the flagship airline of the UK, you paid a little bit more but the service was always a cut above the rest. Now they have decided to turn it into a budget airline where you have to pay extra for everything including the highly priced sandwiches - they even charge for water and if you don't have a card in your pocket you have to go without as they don't take cash.

Nothing special or memorable,11 reviews,04/07/2017,United Kingdom,"  Flew Accra to London Heathrow. All was going well (which in Accra means an orderly boarding), got to the end of the runway when the pilot announced that we would be returning to the stand as there was a discrepancy on the cargo load (I assume more loaded than was on the manifest). The takeoff was terminated seconds before the engines started their job. This then took an hour to sort out (with cargo being removed) - no drinks offered (this was business class I reminded myself). Once off the flight was the standard British Airways club world product. Nothing special or memorable, but at least was not full so the reaching over the dividing screen to serve did not have to happen. Tired business class product, old and tired plane (I wish BA would at least try and not show the interior is patched together with masking tape and something that looks like grouter that you would use in a bathroom). The crew don't really have much to offer now in terms of product, although they were professional if not friendly. Must be terrible working for BA now knowing that the product is so inferior to other international carriers. The inflight entertainment is dire - for regular travellers only the addition of one or two new films, with the rest of the chose the same month after month.

Chose seats 1E and 1F on both legs for my partner and I, and seats were clean, well maintained, fully functioning and very comfortable. Ground service at T5 is a vast improvement with the new First Wing; passed through quickly and met by attentive staff, with prompt and professional service in the Concorde Room. Golden Lounge at Kuala Lumpur less inspiring but staff very good and nice dinner menu. Onboard the staff on both legs were professional, friendly, intuitive, attentive and good natured, and they went out of their way to accommodate our dining requests. Flowers in the bathroom (which was kept clean, though a second bathroom would be helpful as had to wait at times) and amuse bouche provided. Plenty of wine, no shortage of food and nothing ran out - my glass was never empty and the crew knew when to make the bed up without having to ask.

Club World is now very tired and worn,11 reviews,30/06/2017,Ghana," British Airways business class Heathrow to Accra as the BBC reported ""The most delay-afflicted route. 85 out of 122 - or 70% - of flights on this route were delayed by over 30 minutes last summer"". As a regular on this route I can verify these unacceptable delays. Indeed my flight the delay was, as usual, over an hour. The Club World product is now very tired and worn - no updates to it despite the constant updates by other carriers. The BA crew were fine, but not given good enough product tools to outshine other airlines. Usual chaotic boarding process for this flight - the airlines knows it will have issues with hand luggage, but always board the plane with only thirty minutes to departure. It will never work on this routing. When will BA learn? The seating in the usual BA format for business class is just not keeping up with other airlines - including One World members like Qatar, American or Royal Jordanian. The constant having to lower the divider between seats to serve is both rude and poor service. The comfort is now more akin to Ethiopian Airlines on their older aircraft rather than that expected of BA. The LHR-ACC-LHR route is a money maker for BA - they use their old and tired aircraft on the route and milk it for all it is worth. Air France and KLM probably offer a better business class service on this route.

they are failing dismally,R Jarvis,29/06/2017,United Kingdom,"  On the 13th June 2017 I travelled from Mykonos to London Heathrow on BA 651. If British airways are trying to compete with budget airlines they are failing dismally. We were two hours into a four hour flight before the refreshment trolley reached us only to be informed that there were no sandwiches left for us to purchase. All we were offered was a packet of peanuts or a packet of two biscuits. This flight left around lunchtime and I would have thought it would be obvious there would be a large demand for something to eat. To add to the problems of no refreshment being available there was only one card machine in operation. If there is going to be a no cash policy then make sure your staff have the tools to work with. I have today received a telephone call from BA following my initial complaint which really served no purpose. It was a case of sorry but we are working to improve the service which doesn't help me. A service which was very good before the cost cutting.  'We fly to serve' I somehow don't think so anymore. Easy jet, Ryanair and other budget airlines must be clapping their hands with joy as they will benefit from this shambles.

The only information we received was when the captain came of the aircraft to tell us what was happening, he was the only one who cared. BA support and service in Rome was non existent. After take off the cabin crew came around with their trolley of drinks and unbelievably I had to pay £2.30 for a cup of tea despite a 6 delay with no refreshments provided.

BA are going backwards,M Hart,27/06/2017,United Kingdom,"  Chennai to London. What a mistake, I selected this route for a two reasons, I wanted to try the new British Airways 787 in Club class and the timing. But I have nothing good to say about the whole thing. The lounge at Chennai was poor but at least it was near the gate. Once aboard the plane we discovered that instead of what I think should be standard in Business class there is no direct aisle access for the Window seats and if you're in the Aisle seat you'll have people climbing over your legs to access the aisle and the hostess leaning over you to serve the person in the window seat, the layout is quite crazy. The seats themselves are fairly standard business class arrangements but its how BA have crammed them all in that's the issue. I had the window seat and initially I found it OK, but as it was a very long all daytime flight I had to dim the window and that's the point you can only dim them down, there is no blind, the sun still shines through, OK I accept it's like looking through very dark Sun glasses but it's not possible to cut out the light as you get with blinds. I understand several other airlines are retro fitting blinds on the 787 but this is a major error by Boeing. It was my second flight on a 787, both were 11 hour plus flights, the earlier one I made was at night so no issue with the window blinds. I've not noticed any advantage in the higher pressure of the aircraft I find myself just as tired after a flight as I would be on any other aircraft. I'm a long term supporter of BA and I'm so upset that BA are going backwards, focusing on profits and ripping off the customer. Sorry BA but there are so many good airlines out there competing for your business please wake up and start delivering service to customers not just cram them in and take the money, because it won't last, people like me will move on.",Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Chennai to London,01/11/2016,no,Verified,1,2,2,3,2,2,4
"Leg room was atrocious"" ",41 reviews,27/06/2017,Australia,"  Flew London Gatwick to Genoa with British Airways. Fast check in at the smart new premium area at Gatwick. Brand new lounge was really comfortable and with a great selection of food, drink and magazines, access to the lounge not very convenient but given the design of the terminal I realize that nothing can be done about that. The gate number was only announced 20 minutes prior to the gate closing and it was 20 minutes away at at fast pace, especially as there was a queue to exit the lounge by the two elevators. On board our Club Europe seats that we had paid extra to choose, something that no other airline that I know of does with a full Business Class fare, was behind the curtain. Overhead bins were full so ourselves and another 2 Club Europe passengers had to put their bags further back in the economy cabin without assistance. An engineer was called to try to move the divider and curtain back but it was stuck and remained between rows 2 and 3 with our seats being in row 3. My special meal was not on board however the crew member in the premium cabin was very obliging and a crew meal was provided for the short flight. Leg room was atrocious for Business Class and seats are the same as economy. Because the curtain could not be drawn, the Business Class toilet was used by Economy Class passengers and at times Business passengers had to queue behind them. Given the high expectations following the experience on the ground the plane was not up to standard however the service provided despite these lapses was great. Had to wait for about 20 minutes for bags despite being the only aircraft at Genoa Airport. In all this was not a Business Class quality flight, we should have flown economy for a quarter of the price.",A321,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London Gatwick to Genoa,01/06/2017,no,Verified,9,1,4,1,4,2,-1
now providing a very inferior product,11 reviews,27/06/2017,Ghana,"  
Flew British Airways from Beijing to London Heathrow. The cabin crew did their best, but they know they are now providing a very inferior product compared to other carriers. Cut backs are evident everywhere, from the small and very cheap hot towels (offered only once during the ten hours flight) and the nuts (presented in a packet, other than with other airlines on china and warm - this might seem a small niggle, but it is indication of BA saves costs - by annoying their premium cabin customer). The amenity kits, presented in a shoe bag, is a joke really. To be honest one gets a better premium cabin product from other One World members (Royal Jordanian and Qatar for example). Flight left and arrived on time - but the airline should be more than that. The offering within the flight needs to be competitive and regain some ground. Was presented, at the second meal serice, with frozen pawns on bread (returned and a de-frosted plate came by return). Unsure if prawns being frozen and unfrozen as a good idea - but no effect as yet. Part of the seat was covered with food from the previous flight, I covered it up with a spare blanket. Despite there being enough toilets for Club World passengers there was often a line of people waiting from World Traveller Plus - snaking past seat in rows 15 and 16. No control of passengers from World Traveller Plus coming in to the Club World cabin. Toilets were not cleaned through the flight by crew - twice they were in a bit of state so I ended up cleaning the floor with tissues myself. Lovely.

has been hit by cost savings,Kenneth Howie,24/06/2017,South Africa,"  Leeds to Durban via London / Johannesburg. Check in at Leeds was efficient. Security was slow, so fast track was appreciated. Boarding was relatively quick and flight departed early. Seating was reasonably comfortable but cramped, and service is basically non existent unless one is prepared to pay for food. Transfer at Heathrow was a breeze, surprisingly with no further security check. Boarding commenced in good time and was quick and smooth onto the upper deck, with a pleasant greeting from the crew. The premium economy cabin is very pleasant with good seat width and legroom. The seats are comfortable, but both our seats were faulty. Mine would not stay upright and my wife's would not recline. Unfortunately we did not realise the extent of the problem immediately and only reported it next morning. We were moved to business class - we should have reported it immediately! Sparkling wine and fruit juice were offered before take off, unfortunately the quality has been hit by cost savings. Bar service followed quickly after take off, but again the quality of wines was average and not up to the standard offered by other airline in premium economy. We both ordered beef fillet for dinner - alternative was chicken - which was good and served on proper crockery with decent cutlery. Breakfast next morning was economy class fare with plastic cutlery, which along with the cheap and nasty amenity kit lets down the standard and one questions whether the cost saving is really worth the negative impression created. The A380 is very quiet and most passengers seemed to sleep. There were several drink runs during the night, and the cabin crew were quite active. Arrival was on time and everything went smoothly. The final connection to Durban with BA franchise, Comair, was a reminder of the difference between flying in South Africa and flying in Europe.

lack of honesty and transparency,C Rankin,23/06/2017,United States,"  London Heathrow to Paris Orly. I have been a gold member of BA over 25 years making approx 100 flights per year We have been through ash clouds, strikes, IT breakdowns and weather and of late the spiral of poor response has picked up pace. I didnt think it could get worse but it did. Arrived at the airport and my app said on time, screens said on time but my independent tracking app said 3 hours delay. In the first class lounge I was told short delay. Knowing how inaccurate BA can be I asked to speak to special services. One hour later I asked again. I got an arrogant manager who lectured me that she was only two on duty, take it up with Alex Cruz and there were more important flyers like royalty and celebrity. Unimportant is how I felt after 25 years of Gold guest list. She then told me the flight was cancelled and said I would have to either accept the flight the next morning or make my own arrangement .Staff didnt know how to get people out of the airport and despte flights on time for Charles De Gaulle no alternative was offered. I had to concede and cancelled critical business discussion and then beg BA for a refund which they tried to sidestep. The moral of this story is when your gut tells you trust has gone believe it and at BA it is systemic lack of honesty and transparency and it all points to the CEO. The other interesting fact is I did look at choices before booking including Easy jet <100 pounds Air France 500 pounds and foolishly I felt loyalty meant something. Not at this airlin . The salt in the wound is that Easyjet and AF got to their destination on time and no doubt executives on those flights are enjoying a good business day in France. It is incredible that one airline who carry's the British flag is such a disgrace. I am sure that a small percentage are satisfied but looking at the chaos and disbelief in the lounge last night echoes the most common phrase heard in airline speak.

I cannot recommend this cabin,W Charles,20/06/2017,United Kingdom,"  British Airways charges a big premium for Premium Economy. I sat on the top floor of the A380 after being upgraded from World Traveller at the gate, and enjoyed an aisle seat flying from Singapore to London Heathrow. There were two dinner options, chicken tikka or beef fillet, but as I dozed off I missed out. So no food until 1 hour before landing (11 hours later) unless I wanted to pay for chocolates with a credit card. I kindly asked for some water, got some orange juice too - didn't want to push it even though I saw a bottle of champagne open in the galley - not worth the risk of a bad reaction. I cannot recommend this cabin based on the high prices they charge. The staff mean well - however a gulf of enthusiasm exists between them an Singapore Airlines, Qatar, Cathay etc. It's not cultural, it's just indifference.

whether I continue my loyalty,Mike Palmer,19/06/2017,Canada,"  This was my first flight from Toronto to London crewed by ""Mixed Fleet"". Easy check-in at Toronto Pearson (The BA ground staff are always great in Toronto) with fast track meant I was in the lounge 20 mins after arriving at the airport. The lounge remains well run with ok food and a limited (average) wine list. Still too few bathrooms, the seats are tatty, and when busy is not a relaxing place to be. Easy boarding and the first of a few improvements - prosecco now served to London. (used to be only ex London). Fast drinks service after take off with pretzels now back on offer. An OK Chicken curry was served but I still don't see it as Biz class food. A choice of whites and reds wine was offered which reinstates the previous one of each. That is where the improvements ended. The morning offering of a cereal bar and T&Cs / juice remains an insult and just shows how little BA care about the entire journey customer experience. The crew on this flight were great. Young, junior and inexperienced for sure but the two women working my side were friendly and professional. A request for a top up of prosecco was missed due to a short taxi, but appeared (in glass) without asking as soon as the crew were released - classy and well remembered! The return flight was less good. Drinks served promptly after take off and my pre-booked meal arrived first but on the wrong tray. (Crew member's first flight since qualifying) It took some convincing that the plastic cutlery etc was not a WTP tray. The underwhelming snack replacing the second meal was one fun size piece of chocolate and T&C. Customers taking a second chocolate were made to put it back (really) as apparently they are counted out to the exact number of passengers. This cut to service on both legs continues to leave me troubled as after 5 hours I need something more substantial than chocolate. Service reduced - yes, price reduced - no! The 777's in both directions were clean though unless you sit in the first row of WTP, the IFE screens are tiny. Mixed fleet were generally more friendly and interested in making an effort. However, the male crew were more aloof, lacked attention to detail and officious. What these (newer) crews miss, was the more informal / laid back service of Long Haul crew - I hope they relax into the role soon! At least the cuts have stopped (not much left to cut I admit) and small things like choice of wine and pretzels show BA have listened. However, the second meal in both directions being cut on east coast US / Canada routes remains a sore on what was otherwise an ok journey. The jury remains out on whether I continue my loyalty to BA and One World - it really depends on what BA do next - to either value me as a customer (and offer a quality service) or sink even lower in standards from what was once a great airline (at which point - I'm off).",Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Toronto to London,01/05/2017,no,Verified,9,3,3,3,5,3,2

"crews very young, unprofessional",18 reviews,17/06/2017,South Africa," The crews on both the outbound and inbound flights from Johannesburg to London were very young, unprofessional, and were missing the special character and wit that used to make the British Airways crews special and outstanding. They were basically (on both flights) rushing through the service and not to be seen for the next 8 hours before the breakfast service. On both flights, there was no water offered during the night, which is really a shame considered the price difference between economy and premium. The meals were overcooked, and on both flights the knives could not cut through the ""best of British Beef"". Given that the hot meals are the same than in Club (according to BA's marketing), I would have been furious if being offered this quality of food in Business Class. A perfect example of unprofessionalism of the crew was when I got up after dinner and went to the galley (as nobody cared to answer the bell) and asked for a Baileys: the young attendant looked at her coworker and asked her what a Baileys was, and the answer came ""sorry Sir, we don't have that kind of wine. Would you like some white?""

Boarding was a disaster,41 reviews,16/06/2017,United Kingdom,"  Flew Valencia to London Gatwick with British Airways. Check in was a bit disorganised as the check in for business class had a problem with the computer so this caused a delay. Security was a bit slow (no fast track). Business class lounge is quite large but refreshments poor, note this is not a BA lounge as they only have one flight a day and is provided by a local partner. Boarding was a disaster, we were called to board but then waited on the air-bridge for over 20 minutes. The air-bridge was made of glass and was full of people and it soon became very uncomfortable as there was no AC or ventilation and some people seemed close to passing out. Eventually we all returned to the terminal as there was a problem on the plane (apparently a problem with the curtain structure that divides business from economy). There was no communication from the ground staff, which although not BA staff reflects badly on the airline. Once we were finally on-board the flight was trouble free. Good service. Hot meals served but the pasta we chose was not very pleasant. Plane arrived only 10 minutes late having made up a lot of time from the initial delay. priority baggage worked as our case was on the carousel as soon as cleared passport control.

possibly my last BA flights,27 reviews,16/06/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Edinburgh return, possibly my last BA flights. I used economy (or maybe should be re named) economy minus outbound and returned in Club Europe, checked in online however 4 of the 5 checking in kiosks were not working at T5 so in the end collected the boarding pass from the desk. Security quick I'm a BA/Oneworld sapphire member so used the North lounge which was okay. Flight boarded on time but departed 15 min late and arrived 15 min late. A320, seat 11A an exit seat was fine however no service at all on board. Return check in quick as was security, the BA lounge in EDI has been the same for a few years now. It's at least quiet with nice staff and pleasant staff. Boarding through gate 20 on to a pretty old 767 departed 30 min late. Club Europe on domestic flights is a new introduction. Actually it replaced what was BA economy class. A cynical ploy by the BA board to extract more money out of its loyal customers? The aircraft was pretty full so some people like BA although I suspect many passengers were transferring at LHR. Service was okay food economy standard although included in the price. Arrival at T5 around 30 min late 10 min for bags. I fly between 20 & 30 times each year 90% on long haul flights. I have supported BA in the past although I've not used them long haul for about 17 months. Basically they are not good enough. Cut backs and poor service is evident. I expect security comfort and some service when paying £2500+ for a business class ticket. Qatar, Cathay and even SriLankan offer better service. On reflection I fly business class on most flights so I don't actually need any frequent flyer status. The cost of loyalty outweighs the benefits. I might fly BA in future as a very last resort or to use up the miles I've earned. But my loyalty will be my wallet in future.

third world experience,John Drennan,13/06/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Madrid. An absolute third world experience once I got on the plane. Check-in and lounge experience were great, but once I got onboard it became obvious how clapped out some of the 767 aircraft are. There were seats with missing backs and 'Do Not Occupy' covers in front and beside them, random bits of electrical wiring hanging down from rails in the overhead, and grimy, yellowed staining around most of the cabin interior. You have to worry about what's going on the important bits, like the engines, if the same standard is applied outside the aircraft as in the cabin. The crew spent as much time as they could in the galley, and interacted with passengers as little as possible. The breakfast service was a salt-infused hot cooked offering, and just one run of drinks. Anything else you wanted you had to use the call button.

the same price as normal,Jay Gallup,13/06/2017,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Alicante. My wife, my son (4) and me all flew BA Euro Club on our way to Alicante, for some reason when booking Club it was the same price as normal so it was a no brainer. My son has autism so we found the quite lounge amazing way to start our trip as he was very calm before. The staff at BA were very friendly before and on the plane which was a nice touch. Club Euro is a decent service if you pay a little extra, the lounge is a nice start then the extra service is nice on the plane, its a shame like all the other reviews point out the seats are the same it would be nice to have slightly more legroom",A319,Family Leisure,Business Class,Gatwick to Alicante,01/06/2017,yes,Verified,1,3,5,4,5,5,-1
decline across all classes,M Williams,13/06/2017,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Antigua. A frequent flyer with BA for over 15 years, Silver exec club, I have seen the steadily decline of this airline particularly over the past 18 months / Alex Cruz take over. my partner and I fly regularly in eco/prem and club depending on prices, so have seen the decline across all classes. recent trip to Antigua from LGW was awful. A pretty empty cabin, filthy isn't the word, awful in flight entertainment (Rockwell) that hasn't changed in 10 years easily. Food choice is no longer a choice, its a meat dish or veg. alcoholic beverages are loaded at origin (LGW) for both legs, so they have now halved what they usually stocked previously. 3 hours into flight there was no spirits left - bearing in mind only one drink had been served prior to the meal service 1.5 hours in to the flight. BA state in their motto ""to fly, to serve"". Yes they certainly are flying, but most certainly not serving. The cabin crew are ashamed and embarrassed at the cuts which is evident in their conversations at the back of the aircraft, and to anyone who speaks to them they are disgusted with what the bosses have done. They have cheapened the brand of the national carrier, but haven't cheapened their prices. easyjet and Ryanair offer superior, and on long haul its got to the point I will now fly Virgin and others, again offer more for your money in all aspects of the flight. Stop trying to make BA budget, we want it back to how it used to be! All I can say is the compensation passengers will be receiving following the major IT glitch a fortnight ago is one way of paying customers back for the awful attitude and decline in British Airways.",Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Antigua,01/06/2017,no,Verified,3,1,2,1,2,2,1
a bare-bones airline,P Reardon,13/06/2017,United Kingdom, London City to Milan. The price of the ticket about £500 for a 2 hour flight - had no relationship to the ultra-economy service on this flight. The aircraft was very dirty - I wonder whether BA pays for fewer cleaners as other airlines don't seem to have filthy aircraft. In Business the seats are identical to economy so what are we actually paying for? There is no place to power devices and forget WiFi or overhead screens. In business the food was an awful English breakfast. No better than economy. The embarrassed flight attendants seemed to give all the business passengers champagne to take-away to try and make up for the no-frills service. It feels chronic under investment for years has left this a bare-bones airline milking short-term profits and forgetting that their business model should be more than just for 1 year.,E190,Business,Business Class,London City to Milan,01/06/2017,no,Verified,3,2,4,1,2,1,1
very little care of customers,R Burry,13/06/2017,Switzerland,"  Flown economy premium Boston-London Heathrow-Geneva. Again as too often with British Airways nowadays, flight left more than an hour late due to a plane technical problem. As a consequence our connecting flight in LHR was missed, had to wait for 5 hours at LHR although there were earlier flights. Since our late arrival was known by BA at least 5 hours in advance why didn't they at least pre-book our connecting flight from LHR. Long queues at rebooking desk, very little care of customers. Then again flight from LHR left late! Breakfast on board long haul miserable. Service on board short haul now equals those of charter flights.

BA has gone downhill,M Williams,12/06/2017,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Bordeaux. Awful, newish A320 cramped seats. The new buy onboard from M&S does not work! It takes the cabin crew the entire flight to work just about the whole economy cabin, with some people not even getting served. At least easyjet and Ryanair have this down to a tee and serve promptly. BA has gone downhill, and nothing but sad customers and embarrassed cabin crew. BA certainly isn't cutting prices of flights.

a low cost experience,R Drew,12/06/2017,United Kingdom,"  London to Boston return in premium economy. Another very disappointing flight experience with BA. Overall a low cost experience at a premium price. Baggage drop in T5 is now self service unless you fly business or first, which feels like easyjet. Lounge was very busy and choice of food very limited.  The plane was a 23 year old B747, which seemed to be in its original or close to original configuration. The screen in the seat in front of my was the size of my iphone and the choice of movies was very limited. The cabin crew was friendly and did their best to operate in horrible conditions. Food was not edible, i tried the beef option but could not eat it. What i found truly shocking was the snack in morning of the return leg was nothing more than a muesli bar in premium economy. -Cost savings taken to ridiculous levels at BA. They have even managed to find a way to economise on the quality of the sleep mask supplied (no more cotton or other skin friendly material on the inside but awful full nylon / polyester material and only one instead of two straps on back).

Check-in experience was quite good with friendly staff member at Istanbul airport who took my portable phone charger from me. Departure lounge was a bit chaotic due to the laptop ban and checking each passenger's bag manually. On board was average to say the least, in fact it was surprising and a bit disappointing that on British Airways the passengers have to pay for food and drink (nice products but very overpriced). Also, there was no inflight entertainment and the cabin crew were indifferent. The seats on the A320 were also quite hard and uncomfortable. The whole product offering is not good compared to other competing airlines on this route (who have WiFi on many flights, food and drink, IFE). The experience was more like a low cost carrier.

a much lower standard than other airlines,M Spencer,10/06/2017,Australia,"  My wife and I were very disappointed with our British Airways flights from Sydney to London return, flying Premium economy. The food quality, cutlery and service was of a much lower standard than other airlines such as Air New Zealand and Qantas that we have used. There are no toilets allocated for the cabin, and are located at the middle of the economy cabin, quite a long walk and at times a very long line of other passengers waiting to use them. The seats are a bit more comfortable and spacious than economy class, the entertainment viewing screen is ok as are the films music and earphones. BA don't offer priority check in at airports as do other airlines.

it's not really premium economy,W Cooper,10/06/2017,United Kingdom,"  London to Hong Kong on a very new B777-300ER. I was upgraded to WT+ at the gate, owing to a full flight and probably being an Emerald with oneworld. I can now distil the difference in service/product with economy on the same route - with WT+ you will receive one amenity pack (eyeshades, socks, toothbrush), one welcome drink (""cava or water""), one glass for drinking with the first meal, a slightly wider seat (1 inch), minor extra recline (1 inch) and a little extra legroom, as well as a meaty dish for the main dinner (I am vegetarian so picked the vegetarian, which was the traditional BA carby pasta from WT, which was fine). I enjoyed the IFE, the crew were nice and the flight on time. I wouldn't pay a premium of more than £50 for the WT+ experience for this flight, or other WT+ routes. As a service, it's not really premium economy, in fact it's inferior to economy offered by 5 star carriers.",Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Hong Kong,01/06/2017,yes,Verified,5,4,4,4,5,2,4

Caught up in the shambles of BA IT system collapse on 27th May so very lucky to get tickets on flight next day. BA staff hung out to dry by appalling senior management. Flight itself next day, crew excellent but the ancient 747 not so with faulty IFE. Food ok, seat comfy but had seen better days and needed re-upholstering. Was told luggage would be on board as it was stuck in the bowels of Heathrow from the day before, luggage finally turned up Wednesday - 4 days late. Compensation claim into BA rather a lot - hopefully all gets paid. BA have had a number of IT failures past 12 months, simply too unreliable at the moment so will be flying other carriers ((Emirates on this route) for a couple of years until I know BA has resolved its reliability problems and the product offering is more competitive.

one of the worst airlines,9 reviews,08/06/2017,Canada,"  London Heathrow to Vancouver. I am very disappointed by BA's gradual decline. Today I flew in the upper deck of the A380. BA's business class seats, once the best in the industry, are almost the worst. The pods are 8 abreast in the upper deck and very narrow. This is an unpleasant aircraft, with 3 toilets to share between 64 passengers. In business Class I think that's a poor ratio. The flight attendants were initially reasonably friendly (though I noticed no acknowledgement for being a Gold Card holder), but their interest waned as the flight progressed. It took 2 hours to get a drink and almost 4 hours from take off before the main course was served. The beef was cold as were the vegetables. It was actually inedible. I suspect it had just been left out. After dinner we were half way through our 8 hour flight and I was never offered another drink. I gave my suit to be hung up and had to beg to reclaim it at the end of the flight. British Airways has gone from being one of the best to one of the worst airlines I have flown recently. This is a great shame. The cabin is bad, the food is awful, the flight attendants unpleasant and IFE OK.",A380,Business,Business Class,London to Vancouver,01/06/2017,no,Verified,10,2,1,1,4,1,3
Overall not recommended,M Simpson,08/06/2017,United Kingdom,"  I took a long daytime flight from Tokyo to London (about 12 hours). The Boeing 787 seemed fairly new and was clean, and the Premium Economy seat is fairly comfortable for a day flight, with good recline, although unfortunately there is no legrest and a large entertainment box uses up much of the foot space. The catering was really poor and seemed to have been affected by cost cutting: lunch was a small portion of very tough beef, accompanied by a tiny salad which was still frozen; there was then nothing for nine hours (no snacks available anymore) until a second hot meal, of a small chicken curry, was served shortly before landing. A choice of drinks was offered only once, shortly after takeoff; during the entire remainder of the flight the crew came around again twice with water and juice, but nothing else was offered; the second meal came with a minuscule cup of water and nothing else (I asked for more water but the crew said they didn't have any). By the time we landed I was hungry and thirsty, and I would advise anyone using this flight to bring their own food and drink. The crew were invisible for most of the flight.

have become a long haul Ryanair,A Evans,08/06/2017,United Kingdom," British Airways were truly awful on this flight from Heathrow to Miami. Very old tired aircraft. These old aircraft are in desperate need of a refit. Seat back screens unbelievably small. What shocked me most is just how much BA have cut back on their food service. No bag of pretzels with the first drink serving anymore. Dinner was only two choices and one was a vegetarian option. The chicken breast I received was laughable. I have seen bigger chicken nuggets. This came with a inedible salad concoction and a bread roll. The only other food offered was two tiny sandwich triangles for 'afternoon tea' with a miniscule scone. My advice would be to eat before your flight otherwise you will be very hungry. Staff were miserable and on the return leg kept me awake all night by talking very loudly in the galley.

crew on both flights friendly and efficient,Kathleen Kirby,08/06/2017,United Kingdom," We flew out of terminal 5 on Saturday with British Airways to Brussels, and found everyone to be very helpful and friendly, we even had a nice chat with a pilot as we went up in the lift to departures. We got the feeling that people were very anxious to put the disastrous previous days behind them. We used the lounges as we have a silver card, and they were busy, but well staffed, and the food was good. On the aircraft we took our own home made sandwiches since we really didn't fancy the Marks and Spencer prices. I bought a bottle of water close to our gate, and thought that was expensive enough, but the BA on board water was £1.80 per bottle. I did notice that the flight attendants were very good at giving out small glasses of free water. Like many, I can't get used to this budget airways approach, it's clearly embarrassing the staff who are very good. On our return, we had big delays due to the storms in southern England, and air traffic restrictions. Then, we had Brussels air traffic delay due to their system failure. At all times, the first officer kept us well informed and we got back to London and were parked on a good jetty so that we could rush to catch up. This delay was not BA s fault, and the cabin crew on both flights were friendly and efficient. I enjoyed the flight but hope that BA do not make any further cuts, and perhaps think about restoring free food and beverages again one day.",A19,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Brussels,01/06/2017,yes,Verified,3,4,4,-1,5,4,-1

service on BA really is terrible,W Leeson,07/06/2017,United Kingdom,"  London to Johannesburg. After getting caught up in the chaos of the bank holiday weekend IT fiasco and the lamentable way in which the situation was handled by BA, I approached my flight back to the UK with some trepidation. My fears were not unfounded. As the aircraft had been sitting at JNB for most of the day, there were no delays and boarding started very early. I was seat 83A (top deck, double seat) and the leg room was no better than you would find on a Ryanair flight to Dublin. Indeed, due to the location of the electronic equipment box under the seat, it was a little more cramped. The service on BA flights really is terrible. I, along with many other passengers, was treated like an inconvenience and I felt the cabin crew would really have preferred it if we weren't there. I was close to the galley and sleep was pretty much impossible due, in part, to the cabin crew gossiping loudly about other members of staff.

Top quality service, whatever may have declined in economy class, premium economy is as good as ever with 38in leg-room and meals (really tasty in this instance) that can be ordered in advance. The cabin crew are still the BA strength creating a relaxed, congenial atmosphere in the cabin. Smooth connections at Terminal 5 with no waiting (either way) and Tribute Cornish Ale available on the long haul drinks menu, and service is a winner.

deteriorating service recently,G Buss,06/06/2017,United Kingdom,"  Rome to Heathrow. Having used BA Business / Club for some time we always felt it was the little extra treat to add to our holiday. It's been a deteriorating service recently but the last trip to and from Rome was the decider. The cabin was filthy with litter and crumbs from the previous flight on and around the seats. No nuts or nibbles and the drinks were dispensed from open bottles, the miniature wine bottles apparently dispensed with now. There was a choice of meals but you weren't told unless you asked. The meal service no sooner served than it was being cleared away. Altogether we felt that we were an inconvenience to the smooth running of the airline. The advantages of booking club have gone, the lounges being dreadful with little choice of snacks, the priority labels mean you bags come off last, and you only get priority boarding if you scramble past the queue. Add to this that on occasion the boarding pass will fail at security.

Never mind the terrible, dated, seats facing one another, but the BA Sleeper Service mandates you eat in their awful Biz Class lounge at ORD, and then suffer no dinner service on the plane. This is a monumental con. Also, imagine your worst school meal in a school cafeteria, and that is what you get in the BA lounge at ORD. The food was some kind of dreadful steamed slop that you literally would not feed your dog. I used to imagine that long haul business and first class passengers were valued by trans-Atlantic airlines. The British Airways business class product is the worst by far.

very evident cost cutting,Colin Boakes,02/06/2017,United Kingdom,"  I am shocked about how the First Class on board service has deteriorated with very evident cost cutting on what is supposed to be our national flag carrier. On our flight to Tokyo Narita from London Heathrow we were advised by the Cabin Crew soon after take off that the catering supplies loaded were 'limited'. To cut a long story short, this meant that my partner, who was the last to be served, was told what was available rather than asked what he would like. This is in spite of there being only 5 passengers in the 8 seat cabin. For breakfast prior to landing, we were informed that only two cooked breakfasts were available so it would be first come first served. The presentation of the food that was available was poor & certainly not worthy of the fine dining description BA uses for its First Class catering. We spoke to the Cabin Services Manager who was extremely apologetic & confirmed that there has been cost cutting - apparently at the behest of the new CEO who comes from low cost sister airline Vueling, with a resultant increase in unhappiness & complaints from passengers. The famous First Class Tasting Menu we enjoyed on previous flights is now gone & other cost cutting around on board service is very evident - even the rose in the First Class toilet was dead which really epitomises the lacklustre airline that BA has become. I fly regularly long haul with KLM & their new Business Class offering is now far superior to BA's First. How can our national airline, with whom we should be proud to fly, compete with other superior European & Gulf carriers when the emphasis seems to be only on never ending cost cutting that now affects even the most premium passengers? The Cabin Services Manager entered a formal complaint on our behalf from on board on 3 May. Almost a month later, although immediately acknowledged, BA have not responded, probably due to more administrative cost cutting. I should add that the ground service at Heathrow T5 & the Concorde Room were very good but as regards on board service, BA offends their premium passengers like this at their peril.",Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,First Class,London Heathrow to Tokyo Narita,01/05/2017,no,Verified,2,4,2,1,5,1,3

Limited selection of drinks, with wine served in plastic screw-top mini bottles warm with no nuts/nibbles. Meal selection consisted of a chicken salad/prawn (which looked reasonably nice however I'm allergic to seafood) or a toasted cheese roll.

magic of our national carrier has gone,D Lewis,30/05/2017,United Kingdom,"  Choose a budget airline, the magic of our national carrier has gone. We have always chosen British Airways as our preferred carrier where possible and happy to pay a higher premium for the once great service but now it's on par or lower than other low cost carriers. Firstly we didn't get any priority boarding with our two young children. EasyJet provides this. Secondly, we reserved seats as travelling with our two children, they both fight for who is going to sit at the windows. On boarding we were told the plane has changed, therefore we now had assigned seats. Thirdly, after paying over £10 for two small alcoholic drinks for me and my wife I needed the loo, first class was out of bounds. So the only option the rear of the plane, however the crew were busy serving and not prepared to move to allow me past (I guess those drinks they were selling had the BA executive team seeing many ££££ so me being a customer needing the loo was second in priority). After a long period they moved to the rear to allow me past, but once out they had gone back to the middle of the plane. A crew member at the back galley even laughed and said your not getting back and therefore fairly offered me a free cup of tea. Our flight from Heathrow to Bergen was only an hour and 40, but I spent the majority in the rear galley chatting with the said crew member. The return flight the cabin crew had as much enthusiasm as my 80 year old grandmother and technology. The safety briefing came over a tannoy that would have sounded half decent in 1973 and to top it off, the lead steward whilst taxiing for takeof, asked the crew - ""Cabin crew, seats for landing"". The captain gave us an update on takeoff and then radio silence for the rest of the flight, even upon landing he stood at the front having a chat with the said steward as we disembarked about how some machine must have come to life with 'that landing'. All minor points, but they were the points we enjoyed with BA, points that made us choose them, small points that made the difference. The pilots at the end of the flight welcoming or thanking the customer and us thanking them, the cabin crew that always went over and beyond. The free drinks that made us feel special to ask and get, I'd rather pay a premium for all that or choose a budget airline. Gutted our British Airways national carrier has become a budget airline. Perhaps cost savings are needed, but for now, although we are a minor factor and small fry in the bigger picture, they need to cost save some more to make up our future tickets and my recommendations are now also dead. For me their USP was their service, without that there is no longer a point.",A319,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Heathrow to Bergen,01/05/2017,no,Verified,1,3,2,1,2,1,1
wasn't worth the hassle for me,Craig Cain,30/05/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Seoul return. I booked my return flights back in January when BA were having their annual sale for around £1700. Thought this was a bargain as they are usually up around £3000. London to Seoul flight was very pleasant. Didn't get to use the business class lounge in Heathrow as my connection from Manchester was delayed by 40 minutes. Cabin crew on the actual flight were excellent and very attentive. Food and drink was what you would expect of most business class airlines with a decent amount of high-quality menu choices. The seat layout of 2-3-2 with seats facing in the opposite direction to each other and a divider between them felt a little bit cramped. The seats were very comfortable and went flat which is better than some, however there is a fold-down seat/step in front of you that you have to use to able to stretch out fully. I'm 6'0 and found I was at my limit of being able to stretch out fully so anyone taller than that would probably be a bit uncomfortable. Inflight entertainment had a decent range of tv and films to choose from including some of the more recent releases. Toilets were also smaller and more cramped than on other airlines that I've flown business class with before. The only let down was that the cabin itself was hotter than the sun and I found it difficult to sleep because of this. Seoul to London was what really let BA down for me and left a sour note on what was an amazing 3 months in Korea. In the days leading up to the flight, BA's ""massive IT Failure"" and the lack of information and help surrounding it meant I was having to frantically check if my flight would be leaving at all, with the flights on the 27th and 28th being cancelled completely. Luckily they got it sorted in the early hours of the morning on the day of the flight. The flight and cabin crew arrived late for the flight and so take-off was delayed by 30 minutes. I had a connecting flight to catch to Manchester so it was imperative that everything went smoothly as I had just over an hour after landing to make it. The flight was lovely with the cabin crew doing an amazing job. The pilots managed to make up for lost time and so we ended up landing 5 minutes earlier than scheduled. However, due to the backlog of delayed and cancelled flights from the past couple of days, there was another flight in the space where mine was supposed to park. This meant a delay of 20 minutes while we waited on the tarmac for the space to become free. This was time I could not afford to lose. We eventually disembarked at 14:45 which meant I had to sprint through the airport to passport control and to the baggage reclaim. Really wish I hadn't as it still took 20 minutes for the bags to come off the plane. By the time I had done all this and gone through arrivals it was 15:15 and the gate was closing in 10 mins. Talked to BA customer services and got rebooked on another flight back to the IOM (where I live) from London City but they could only book me on the 14:50pm flight the next day. Wasn't at all happy with the experience overall because of this and for what you would normally pay (over £3,000 when not on sale) it really wasn't worth the hassle for me personally.",Boeing 787-8,Business,Business Class,Seoul to London,01/05/2017,no,Verified,7,4,5,4,3,3,3
business class is very cramped,R Warren,29/05/2017,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Lima return in Business Class. No choice of seats until 24hr before the flight unless you paid extra (I understand their desire to reward frequent flyers but paying £50+pp per flight if you aren't is just a huge irritation factor when you have already forked out so much for biz). By the time we were able to check in, there was only one option left if we wanted to sit together. New BA lounge at LGW smart but packed out at the start of Easter holidays. Limited food offering at breakfast - no hot food at all, unless you count lukewarm pastries. FA service on flights in both directions was good, though outbound the cabin lights were switched off for the entire flight between meal services, despite it being a day flight. Food and drink were fine but nothing special - some choices not available by the time they got to us. Seating layout of 2-4-2 in business class is very cramped, especially if the flight is full - the highest-density seating I've ever experienced in business - and there was no surface to put anything on unless you had your tray table open. Small drawer at your feet. Recommend the window seat next to the bulkhead if you're travelling solo - no legs to climb over! Lie-flat seat was comfortable though for a short person. IFE was poor compared to competitors - hard to angle the screen appropriately with a limited choice of movies available. On the way home we didn't mind a long layover at LIM as we thought we could use the lounge. No such luck - we couldn't be checked in all the way through from LPB so had to pick up luggage, go through immigration again and wait several hours in a hot airport with hardly any seats before BA staff appeared to check in the flight home. Only seat choice available again were two together on the aisle side of a middle pair. Very fortunate not to have anyone in the other middle seat next to me, otherwise it would have felt very intimate with a total stranger! Haven't travelled long-haul with BA for several years and can only describe it as a functional, value service, even in Business, though it's not cheap. I'd only use BA again if they were the most convenient by a long way (as happened here for a direct flight from London), or for a great price on short-haul. There's really no comparison to Emirates' long-haul offering in Business.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Gatwick to Lima,01/04/2017,yes,Verified,6,4,4,4,3,4,2

We then learnt from the steward that it's a new configuration that hasn't gone down very well with customers.

My last flight was with two friends for our annual outing, this year to Bilbao. Cannot fault the staff or flight crew. However, the cancellation of free on board food for short haul is stupid. There is now no reason to use BA for short haul when there is a low cost alternative. This cost cutting may well back fire.

little to no service,M Sissel,24/05/2017,Ireland,  Kuala Lumpur to London. Very different from the flight over. It's all about the crew and how they perform or how serious they take their job. One crew was rude and when asked could I have a glass of water told me that it would take a long time and he disapeared down the back to chat to his fellow workers.  The food was slapped up and we were not offered another drink. All male crew and due to it being an night flight the crew spent the time down the back and ignored when called. It's a shame when you see BA trying to turn around and survive and then you have lazy rude staff giving little to no service to the customers or the airline.,Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to London,01/05/2017,yes,Verified,7,4,1,1,5,4,5

overall truly awful experience,S Roper,23/05/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Miami. I was looking forward to this flight - it was Saturday so no work the following day and 62K on the upper deck used to be such a treat! I have read many reviews recently of BA falling behind the competition so my expectations were low - but even these were beaten by this overall truly awful experience. Firstly I have to say the crew on the flight were super in every way. Nothing was too much trouble and they seemed to genuinely be enjoying their work. I should have given my 'BA Golden Ticket' to one of them but forgot. However no matter how good the crew, it cannot make up for everything else being totally awful and shabby. The seat was filthy with what looked like ketchup from the previous flight and crumbs everywhere. Not a nice start. The aircraft was very very old - a lot of the interior was patched up with white gum. The IFE didn't work properly. Amenity kit was a bag and the headsets poor quality. The toilets (compared to AA) were small unpleasant. Seat is not up to most Business class standard. Food was awful and the 'club kitchen' almost non-existent. These days I would choose AA (or Delta, United, Virgin) any day over BA. It was a shame the flight manager seemed to spend his time going round the cabin apologising and giving some avios to try and make people less annoyed by the whole experience.",Boeing 747-400,Business,Business Class,London Heathrow to Miami,01/05/2017,no,Verified,2,2,4,1,1,1,1
attendents cordial and professional,D Kramer,22/05/2017,Russian Federation,"  Moscow Domodedovo to Houston via London Heathrow roundtrip in economy class.  All the flights were full in economy, with the exception of BA195 which was 2/3 to 3/4 full. British Airways flight attendents are cordial and professional. There was a wide range of beverages served, including complementary alcoholic beverages. The standard in-flight meals were not bad, but not great either. The 10-hour flight between London and Houston featured a dinner early in the flight and a snack at the end of the flight. The 4-hour flight between London and Moscow featured a snack at the beginning of the flight. I was surprised by the leg room in economy. I am not tall, but at 180 cm tall (71 inches), I was able to extend my legs fully under the seat in front of me. This made these long flights bearable. Both flights offerred headphones, blankets, and pillows. The cabin temperature on the flights to Houston was cold - I had to put on a light jacket. The cabin temperature on the flight from London to Moscow was too warm - I was sweating. When people are using the flight safety card to fan themselves, you know it is warm. The in-flight entertainment screen on the B777 in economy is of poor quality and needs to be upgraded. I could feel the heat being emitted from the screen as well.

BA have hit rock bottom,4 reviews,22/05/2017,United Kingdom,  London Heathrow to Brussels. Disappointed by the non existent service onboard this flight. Regardless of how short the flight may well be you expect some sort of refreshments/snacks to be provided given this isn't a low carrier airline.

a positive experience,R Stratton,19/05/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to San Francisco return and pleasantly surprised with the service. All flights were on time and arrived ahead of schedule. Online check-in and baggage drop straightforward and without hassle. Food was excellent - particularly on outbound flight. My partner is vegetarian, and we both opted for vegetarian Hindu meal which proved to be delicious. Aircraft in good order and clean. Cabin crew - particularly on way out - were professional, attentive and friendly. Inflight entertainment choice was generally good, offering something for everyone. The only criticism is that seat-choice function is too expensive - even for economy class. British Airways are being very greedy in this respect, and their charges are way higher than other carriers.

The first flight was slightly delayed, but our transfer time was more then 3 hours, so that didn't cost any problem. The cabin crew did their best to statisfy every passenger at the flight to HND. When we got our luggage we discovered that one of the suitcases was damaged. At HND Japan Airlines is the agent for British airways and as it cost time to explain everything. Their service was great. They filed a report to BA and when we are back from the journey we should contact BA to claim the damage. We did and within a few days we got a really extensive response and were compensated. Despite this damaged suitcase it was handled great.

Overall very disappointing,Ian Robinson,16/05/2017,United Kingdom,"  Antigua to Gatwick. Check in at the new terminal was quick and efficient (better than Gatwick) and although we had a slight delay at immigration, we were soon airside. The new lounge was really comfortable and although we didn't use it (it was dark when we were there) they have an excellent sky terrace with loungers and shaded sofa's etc. The bar was manned by helpful staff with a small but tasty selection of food. Boarding was on time. On board it was soon evident that the interior of the plane had seen better days with my wife's TV nearly falling off its mounting. Fortunately she was able to position it during the flight so that it stayed in place but it was quite precarious. Push back and departure was exactly on time. Within a short time the crew started the evening service and this is where it all seemed quite strange. Unlike the flight out, where there was a more relaxed atmosphere, the crew seemed to feel there was a need to rush whatever they were doing to the point that some of them were literally running down the aisles. The food was hurriedly delivered to us and was disappointingly under seasoned and pretty tasteless. I can only assume that the object of their haste was to get everyone fed and watered and bedded down as quickly as possible. To be quite honest I felt like we were being looked after by a nanny and told to go to bed early and I almost expected them to say 'I want you to go to sleep now and I don't want to here a sound out any of you until the morning'! Now I know that the crew are all entitled to their breaks etc, but at the end of the day (or night) they are working and are getting paid to do so. In my opinion if they just slowed down a little and had more time for the passengers, it would improve the flight considerably. Breakfast was OK although I seemed to be the only person trying the bacon rolls and after one mouthful I understood why. In a blind tasting I probably would have guessed I was eating rubber bands. We arrived on time and after quite a long walk to immigration and the baggage reclaim, our cases were waiting for us.

the crew were fantastic,P Andrews,15/05/2017,United Kingdom,"  I was pleasantly surprised with British Airways on both outbound and inbound flights from Orlando to Gatwick after reading the reviews. I would go as far as to say I would choose them over Virgin now unless there was a dramatic price difference. The crew both ways were friendly and really helpful, I have found Virgin crew to be a bit up themselves thinking they are a cut above the rest. Contrary to how Virgin crew are on an overnight flight (serve food, dim lights and keep out the way until hour before landing) BA crew still regularly came round making sure everyone was ok and if anyone wanted anything. We had nearly 3 hour delay leaving Orlando on G-VIIU, firstly due to inbound being a bit late due to an alligator closing the runway and finally a medical issue on board whilst positioned on runway to go. We returned to gate for paramedics, top up of fuel etc and departed at 20.20 versus 17.35. Throughout the crew were fantastic bringing drinks round and keeping us all informed. Whilst the interior of the leisure fleet of 777 is a bit on the tired side it was still comfortable I can recommend 24D as there is no PAX seat behind just a crew seat so no issues with being kneed in the back. For economy class leg room was good. Food was fairly decent for aircraft food. Only slight negative was the dated AVOD as it has small screens and not a great deal of choice compared to more modern systems.",Boeing 777-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Gatwick,01/05/2017,yes,Verified,2,5,5,5,5,5,3

not improving where they should,10 reviews,13/05/2017,Italy,"  London to Santiago de Chile. Surprisingly pleasing flight onboard Boeing 787, decided to give it a try to a rear facing business class window seat and discovered the B787 is - or looks - far lighter and wider than any B777 I've been travelling on (could be larger windows or the fuselage shape which makes the ""cocoon"" look less cramped). Even the seat looks wider, while the IFE screen is wider with a higher resolution. The odd ""ying-yang"" layout is slightly better on Boeing 787 as the central rows do not have the honeymoon seats, therefore you won't share such a narrow space with a stranger in case you end up there. So first impression better than usual; unfortunately the soft product remains way below par (I pre-ordered the main dish of the meal which this time was actually available, but the beef was overcooked and chewy), I will never stop mentioning that the amenity kit is simply ridiculous - sort of a blue shoe bag, too small to fit shoes though. The crew very friendly but slightly less attentive than usual. Overall the experience was better than usual - mainly thanks to a newer, quieter aircraft - but BA is not improving where they should, in those details that make business class something worth EUR3,000 spent. Still no wi-fi on BA. Not commenting the ying-yang layout, which remains a mystery to me (who approved such a nonsense?).",Boeing 787,Business,Business Class,London to Santiago de Chile,01/05/2017,no,Verified,2,3,4,2,3,3,4

As a regular flyer with BA, my experience is that they have some of the best pilots and their inflight staff make all the efforts to give the airline an image. Beyond that, they have some of the worst airport desk staff in the industry. They have no solution for the slightest problem! We were scheduled to fly to Amsterdam on the 1st of Feb at 07.45, there was a radar problem in Amsterdam. Easyjet etc were informing their customers of development, nobody informed anyone at the BA desk until it became a confusion at almost 09.30! We were rescheduled to the 11.40 flight with another further 2 hours delay. Before this I have been advised to book a ticket to guarantee a seat on the 11.40 flight.

The check-in was smooth which encouraged me that I had made the right choice. However on-board the ageing Boeing 747 nothing else was worth talking about, the food and the service are clearly working to a lower standard than I have previously had with BA. The space available was tight for me; an average sized man - I don't know how a larger and or taller person would manage.

So no common sense there. Despite having other seats available in the business area, they refused to move me, even though they were seeing the issue (I couldn't fit in my seat for a 10 hour flight). They even told us off as they were getting aggravated by us being nosy! I had to pay extra 100 pounds each way to reserve 2 seats! Needless to say the food is awful and the service overall is 0/5 stars. This is not the BA that people once knew.

My 'randomly' allocated seats were middle seats in the back two rows on both flights, seems like punishment for not paying their charge to select seats. I'm not too bothered about the lack of drinks / meal service but can see that the system they have created is a shambles - no cash payment option, not enough stock etc etc. On arrival back at Heathrow T5, we were parked on a remote stand by T3 and then had to wait an hour for a bus to the terminal.

the flight was enjoyable,Ian Robinson,09/05/2017,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Antigua. This was our first time in quite a while travelling from the South Terminal and the first impression was that the BA check in area was a little cramped. It was quite busy at the CW check in with about five couples in front of us but as there were four desks open, we were through in about five minutes. The fast track security was quiet and we were soon in the new lounge. This is a huge improvement from its predecessor in the north terminal with nice views, comfortable seats and reasonable food (I had a small bacon roll and a very strange omelette roll?). The departure gate was quite cramped with not enough seating for all of the passengers but as the flight was on time, it didn't really matter. We had made the decision some time ago not to pay an additional cost to select our seats prior to the 24 hour check in as this would have cost up to £340 for my wife and I, depending where you wanted to sit. However, we were pleasantly surprised with the seats we were allocated as we would probably have chosen these anyway. After boarding we were offered a glass of sparkling wine, which for a change was pleasantly chilled. The staff were generally friendly, especially a young guy who said it was his first long haul trip. Once airborne we were offered two drinks with nuts before lunch and then more drinks with lunch. We had pre ordered our food so we knew what we were getting although the quality was just OK (I ordered a chicken curry which was rather bland). The interior of the plane was rather showing its age with stains on the carpet with an overall drab ambience. Also, the IFE seems to be getting worse and unusually my wife found it difficult to watch a film due to the poor resolution. Afternoon tea was OK although no provision was made for my wife's sandwiches (she is a vegetarian) so we had to mix and match between the two of us. We landed on time in Antigua.

Had checked in online so no contact with ground staff, and having arrived to berlin from Beijing with a tight connection I did not bother to use the Terraces lounge here.

Boarding was quick, only 5 out of 16 seats occupied in club cabin. Seats having limited seat pitch and are economy style with middle seat empty. Captain very informative, and they are BA's biggest asset for the details provided to customers. A hot chicken sandwich, cheese & biscuits and chocolate mousse was served - all to a good standard.

a surly disapproving stewardess,A Wiggins,05/05/2017,United Kingdom,"  Travelled to Bangkok recently for work. Tired old plane with vintage entertainment system. Drinks were served before dinner, no nuts/crisps available followed by a passable but small dinner. As it was around 20.30 uk time, I pressed the call button to ask for an after dinner drink for my colleagues and myself. After a 20 minute wait a surly disapproving stewardess arrived and gave us a dressing down essentially for still being awake and requiring service. Incorrect drinks were then brought. My colleague asked another steward who was across the cabin chatting to what appeared to be friends to correct the mistake but was told to wait. Eventually the correct drink was brought. I've written a letter of complaint but as yet no response from British Airways. I've flown BA a great deal and generally had a reasonable experience so it's disappointing to see the general direction the airline seem to be going. The company I was working for paid for the ticket so I don't know what it cost but don't imagine it was cheap.

Staff were very friendly and professional on both sectors. Flights on time. Food and drink choices/quality were decent, but not on a par with some other carriers. It's clear BA's cost cutting affects all cabins. On the outbound leg my choice of main course was unavailable as they had already been given to other passengers. Having said that, I could have ordered in advance via the web site. On the return leg, it's worth noting that access to/from the lounge is via a single elevator and very time consuming. So it was a nice touch that one of the ground staff escorted me and my wife (we are both gold card holders) from the lounge and put us on the aircraft first as the boarding gate was chaotic due to it being a holiday weekend.

downgraded their economy service,17 reviews,04/05/2017,United Kingdom,"  BA12 onboard British Airways A380 for the gruelling 13 hours from Singapore to London Heathrow is pretty hellish for economy passengers. I'd like to be biased to BA - I'm silver member and British and it's my national carrier but come on let's get to the chase. This route is now also served by Garuda and Singapore and I can say BA are at the bottom of the list for the economy service. Seats are really uncomfortable and near impossible to find an angle to get some rest, the pillows are wafer thin - like sitting on a a bunch of tissues bundled together. Food is lousy and they have removed the silverware and dinner extras like crackers, chocolates and other things that you can snack on. They close down the rear galleyway and turn it into their personal hang out area instead of a self service drink and snack zone like other airlines. This also means you are stuck in your aisle which is frustrating when you want to get to an unoccupied toilet in the other aisle and your toilet section has queues. Further toilets are not regularly cleaned and soap ran out half way through the flight and wasn't refilled. BA have downgraded their economy service in all areas and you feel like the crew treat you like a poor peasant - polite and respectful but minimum effort. On the plus movie selection is great and TV on the A380 is good but not in Singapore Airlines league. Your air miles earning for this route is more generous than Garuda and Singapore. I Would recommend premium economy if you can or If you have to make this route try and get upper deck where configuration is 2-4-2 rather than 3-4-3 downstairs. Or alternatively try the competition which will soon include Norwegian Air and I can't see how Norwegians' economy class can be any worse than BA's.",A380,Business,Economy Class,Singapore to London Heathrow,01/05/2017,yes,Verified,1,3,4,3,5,4,4

a poor service all round ,Andrew Macleod,03/05/2017,United Kingdom,"  Glasgow to Chicago via Heathrow and took the offer to upgrade to Premium economy at an extra cost. What a disappointment, the aircraft was an old 747-400 badly in need of a refit. Cabin was tired and very shabby decor and seats inflight video system was ancient and had to be rebooted for it to work. This took until 40 minutes into flight snd kept jumping through flight. Staff were nice but no noticeable difference to economy. In fact the economy section on the refitted 747 on the return flight BA 296 was better than the premium offer on outward leg. To be honest BA had a cheek to charge for this supposed 'premium product' This was never an upgrade especially compared to the equivalent product on Virgin. To make matters worse the BA customer service reply to our issues raised was just not good enough just a standard corporate apology effort. With no regards for keeping future business.

I have lost my patience,Dave Houlihan,03/05/2017,Bahrain,"  I have always given fair reviews to any airline. With BA and being a Gold (Emerald) member I have lost my patience. I have tried now for a week to book flights online and via their call centre to book and upgrade. Whilst the site shows availability it then croaks to a halt with an error, it has been 7 days of this. I have contacted BA through their twitter account to be told to call their Bahrain call centre, which of course does not work but have been told to call the Indian centre. 4 times I have called at my own expense to get people with poor English, have no idea how to manage the upgrade, quote outrageous prices 4 times the web price. Social media twitter just go through the motions rather than having some one take control.

Absolutely useless,Andrew McLean,03/05/2017,United Kingdom,  London Heathrow to Edinburgh. Almost hilarious had I not just been handed my debit card back when the plane was advised to put their tray tables back in the upright position. I was in row 12 the first 7 were business class. I was the last to be offered food or a drink. I had the sandwich and wine when I got home. It would have been easier to buy the sandwich (bigger choice at M&S) at Edinburgh airport. The budget airlines could show British Airways how to do a proper operation. The remaining 10 or so rows go no apology and nothing to eat or drink.

never seen an airline deteriorate so quickly,H Cutts,02/05/2017,Slovakia,"  Flew London Heathrow to Vienna. Wow, who is running this company? In over 30 years of flying I've never seen an airline deteriorate so quickly as British Airways has recently. I can accept that I now have to pay extra if I want to check in a bag, but to sit on a 'full-service' airline for over 2 hours without so much as a complimentary cup of water, really? Did I miss something, have they lowered their prices? No, they just want suckers like me to pay more for something that was (and still is at their prices) included in the fare. BA now offers all food and drinks for purchase but the service was so slow and by the time we'd almost reached our destination there was a bit of an argument with a passenger who'd ordered a hot sandwich, but because the payment machine wasn't working, they took the food back to the galley and left the passenger without. The atmosphere was pretty grim, it's been a few years since I've experienced such a miserable economy flight. That was probably Ryanair but they've really raised their game. British Airways was a great carrier, even a year or so back, but now it's really overpriced rubbish, and they don't make me feel welcome anymore.

Aircraft full but boarding and seating was well handled by the ground staff. The aircraft left 10 mins early, arrived 15 mins ahead of schedule. Within one hour of arrival we were at the gate for our connecting flight to Aberdeen. Service was OK but things are not as they were with British Airways. Food bland and unexciting, drinks service limited. Breakfast was served way to late in the flight. No major complaints, toilets clean and functional. Inflight entertainment worked OK but the volume/ bud type headphones were poor and distorted the dialogue which was hard to follow. Picture was OK. Cabin crew were polite and did their job.

Service was an absolute shambles,M Coates,01/05/2017,United Kingdom,"  Heathrow Terminal 3 to Budapest in April 2017. Busy flight before the bank holiday weekend resulting in most wheelie bags being taken off passengers. Seated in row 12F which was the 6th row of economy class. After taking off on-time, it took 70 mins for the food trolley to travel 6 rows. Service was an absolute shambles! 2 staff serving a full flight whilst 2 other staff serve approximately 12 people in business class. Instead of the standard routine of the person each side of the trolley serving different rows, one steward just stood there whilst the stewardess struggled to use the iPad payment machine. Instead of prioritising passengers yet to be served, the stewardess kept serving rows she had already served (because they had finished their drinks in the time it took her to travel 4 rows). The senior purser then appeared and told off the clearly flustered staff that they had most of the plane to serve with only 45 mins of flight time left!

pleasant and enjoyable experience,Tony Spitale,01/05/2017,Switzerland,  Zürich to London Heathrow. As part of a 12-days-trip almost around the world my first leg from Zürich to London was on British Airways. It turned out to be quite a pleasant and enjoyable experience. Thanks to early online-check-in I managed to secure a bulkhead aisle-seat. I would have preferred a window-seat though. Boarding started on time and there was a very friendly purser welcoming the passengers. After I settled down I approached her with my request. She said that the flight was completely full but promised to do her best. After less than five minutes she returned to me and offered me a seat at the window but emphasized that my actual seat had much more legroom. So I stayed. The rest of the crew seemed to be cheerful and happy too. Special requests by other passengers were dealt with professionalism. I brought my own snack and water along which was a wise thing to do as the catering-service was slow. The new procedure takes too much time and let passengers disappointed as their choice is running out quickly. BA should reinstall the old system again. The cabin was spacious but the aircraft showed its age. The flight took off with a delay of 20 minutes but was a the gate at Terminal 5 15 minutes before scheduled arrival time.,Boeing 767,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Zürich to London,01/04/2017,yes,Verified,1,4,5,-1,4,4,-1

what you expect from a budget carrier,Dayne Moir,30/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  British Airways from Aberdeen to London Heathrow. The service was what you would expect from a budget carrier like EasyJet or Ryanair. The only difference that the price was 150% more expensive. EasyJet offer a service from Aberdeen to London Gatwick for around £50 return. This flight cost myself and my girlfriend £160 each. There were no complementary snacks offered, we had to pay £60 each on top of that for our luggage to be added to the hold. The only reason we flew British Airways was because we had a connecting flight from Heathrow with another airline. British airways use the excuse for the high fair and no frills because of the ""fees"" they have to pay at Heathrow. I don't buy it though. Our connecting flight from Heathrow cost £420 each and was a 14 hour flight. Yet a 1 hour and 30 minute flight with BA costs £220 each.

avoid any 747 flight whenever possible,Clive Drake,27/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  Newark to London Heathrow. You have to be very careful when choosing a flight to New York. Most of the JFK flights are 20+ years old Boeing 747-400s - prone to breaking down on the tarmac. The 747 ""New 1st"" is so cramped and I avoid any 747 flight whenever possible. I deliberately choose Newark as it is served by a new Boeing 787. Coming back we were on one - with just 8 seats in 1st Class. Its not bad, a bit better than the Boeing 777 - but nowhere close to Singapore Airlines, Emirates etc. The lounge is a shared one with Cathay Pacific. Its ok, but apart from a ""1st"" dining area, 1st class passengers are bundled in with Club passengers. It is a nice set up though. Boarded on time and had dinner. Tasteless starter of prawns and fennel. Horrible soup. Chicken mains was ok. Wines ok. The bed was made up and I slept for a few hours. We were not stacked for once and landed ahead of schedule. Plane seemed pretty empty and Club was very empty. Club is a lousy set up and the seat is appalling.

saved £10 for two bunch of flowers,Clive Drake,27/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Newark. We had heard a lot about the BA First Class ""wing"" at LHR and after checking in we made our way through it - directly from the check in area. The security and screening area is prompt and you find yourself in the First of the BA 1st Class lounges. If you did not know about the more exclusive ""Concorde"" lounge you would probably plonk yourself down here - as the check in staff did not mention the better lounge. The first one was rammed - end to end and we negotiated our way around the bags and carry on luggage strewn all over the place. The Concorde lounge was half empty and we had breakfast in the dining area. It was okay. The lounge is long, long overdue for a refurbishment. The Boeing 777 was parked at the B terminal and we were shown to our seats by a friendly FA. Champagne was served and for once it was chilled. The cabin looked a little tired and I suspect the plane was one of the first to have New First. We had the new Liberty branded wash bags which was light years ahead of the tacky bags we had last December. No amuse bouche - and no flowers in the WCs. There were nine passengers in First - and with an average spend £3,000 - one way, the total revenue would have been circa £36,000. Well done BA, you saved £10 for two bunch of flowers in the loos and 9 x £5 for the amuse bouche - grand saving of the operating costs a massive £55. Lunch was chosen from the cheap tacky menus (Pizza Express is better quality) - and my eyes popped as I read the lead appetizer, and I quote: ""Loch Fyne Kinglas smoked salmon with Oscietra caviar, Burford egg, shallots, creme fraiche and chive cress."" Oh my goodness - Caviar. My excitement was short lived. I had caviar alright - but just five eggs. (Yes folks 5 eggs, not 5 grams) You had to laugh. The soup was horrible. The salad never arrived. The main cod fillet and cod cheeks was very good in indeed. Wine ok. FAs all fine. We landed ahead of schedule - and whoever landed the plane was a zen master pilot.

don't expect much nowadays from BA,Clive Drake,26/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Gatwick to Pisa. I fly this route often and this flight was my first out of the South Terminal. Its not as ""user friendly"" as the North - and meanders around, up and down - all over the place. Could also do with a refurbishment. We approached the new BA lounge, which is easy to miss not being in the best place in the Terminal, with reservations as everything BA does nowadays is cheap and skimpy. Pleasant surprise - its pretty top notch. Good food and plenty of booze. Nice and airy with spacious seating. We wondered for a moment if we had wandered into the wrong lounge. All good so far. Then the flight was called and our new found love affair with BA quickly receded. The walk to the gate was miles, it took us 15 minutes - and needed a bit of a run as well. Arrived all nice and sweaty. Plane was busy and we had the front row (the best seats). Usual disappointment with the lousy seats - economy masquerading as business seats. Plane old and dirty. The WC was disgusting - dark and dingy and the ""bowl"" - well, I dare not even try and describe it here - save it looked like the previous person had not flushed it - leaving a permanent effect. Took off on time. My wife had the sandwiches - which she said was dry and tasteless. I settled for a couple of Gin and Tonics. You don't expect much nowadays from BA and therefore you are disappointed - before you get a chance to be disappointed. Crew were fine - and don't like the BA cost cuts. As one said ""we spend half the flight apologising to passengers."" They also said charging economy customers for food had gone down like a lead balloon.

I prepared myself for the worst,S Dawkins,24/04/2017,United Kingdom," Singapore to London Heathrow - after reading the negative reviews and the press about BA of late, I was not expecting much at all from this trip. Terminal 5 is a breeze and has to be one of the best things about flying with BA, we checked in and cleared security within 20 minutes. We secured seats on the upper deck of the A380, which seemed more intimate than if we were on the lower deck. Seats were comfortable for the journey and entertainment fine. BA cabin crew seemed rushed throughout the journey, lead purser was busy talking when guests were entering the aircraft, no hello from her or acknowledgement. Once we got to our seats, there was no space left in the overhead lockers, no help from cabin crew but didn't expect any either, they just looked on and told us where not to store our bags. Food was kept to the bare minimum for this 13.5 hour journey with 2 hot meals provided at dinner and breakfast, nothing in between. I was actually surprised to receive the second hot meal for breakfast. We got more food and snacks on our Qantas flight from Singapore to Australia, which was much shorter at 7 hours. I still cannot understand how BA are considered a 4 star airline! Qantas also a 4 star airline was much better! In all I was not disappointed with BA, as I prepared myself for the worst.

told snacks had been withdrawn,S Lennon,24/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  Bangkok to London Heathrow. Boarding was the usual farce with unintelligible boarding announcements resulting in a free for all. The flight was packed full. The inflight entertainment system didn't work for the entire flight - this is a 13 hour flight and also with time spent on the ground waiting for push back nearly 14 hours. I have noticed that BA don't seem to care about IFE not working on BA0009 and BA0010 as it has been quite usual on this route for some passengers to be complaining but this time it was an aircraft wide problem effecting all passengers. The captain made a number of announcements apologising and asking passengers for patience and explaining that it wasn't the cabin crews fault, they were obviously experiencing passenger dissatisfaction. He explained that the system had overheated - well that calms things! I do not eat the served meals on board due to becoming very unwell on a previous BA0009 flight I never want to experience again, so I was looking forward to eating the snacks which are usually available, however I was told they had been withdrawn - I was not happy but had brought a sandwich from the airport so although felt very hungry. I managed but remembered how well EVA air compare with sandwiches and even pot noodles between meals! The cabin crew were nice but after serving meals stored their trolleys between the two aft toilets next to the rear doors both sides of the aircraft effectively blocking access to all the 4 toilets. Passengers wanting the toilets had quite a struggle to push past them. I have never seen or experienced this on any flight and wondered if this is actually a safety concern. ie blocking doors? I also experienced sinus problems, pain and congestion which is I believe due to the air quality on Boeing 777 airplanes, the air being very dry with little humidity. I do take precautions but it has taken a month to recover from the terrible headaches, sinus pain and congestion. I only experience this after flying on 777's and there are flight crew forums on line discussing 777 air quality problems. The captain was on hand to apologise for disembarking passengers and was clearly annoyed that the plane was not fully serviceable. I complained to BA and also emailed CEO Alex Cruze having been urged to do so by the crew. My email to the CEO was forwarded to customer services, no surprises there. Customer Services who replied quickly, investigated and confirmed that there were time constraints loading food and a full compliment was not loaded hence no snacks. I was advised that the lack of IFE would be investigated by their maintenance team. They would not acknowledge any problem with the air quality but I didn't expect them to. By way of compensation I was given 3000 Avios points which to me is paltry especially as those points have been radically devalued for economy passengers, they are worth a third of what they were a year ago and can only be used where Avios are accepted! Frankly I am disappointed in both the flight and BA's level of compensation, I have tried to stay loyal to our national carrier but currently have no confidence anything will be done to improve the passenger experience on this route. The only way to check is to fly that route again with BA, do I risk it ?

something has gone terribly wrong,G Leader,23/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  Belfast to Seoul via London Heathrow. Pretty poor. Short haul connection to London was good, before you had to pay for food and drink and genuinely felt like there was more leg room than the long haul. Flight from London was very cramped, I'm slightly above average height but by no means a giant and I really struggled to get comfortable. Seat was too narrow, very little leg room and the space to put my feet was taken up by what I assume was the processor for the IFE system for the seat in front. The seat was very narrow and got pretty uncomfortable after around 2 hours. The food was ok, nothing special. Not very much of it and the thimble of drinking water you get every few hours is hardly enough. As a child I remember the food on BA flights being very good but something has gone terribly wrong. Staff are one of the few things BA has going for it at the minute, one of the few things left from the BA of old when it was actually worthy of the name. Friendly staff on the flight and in the airport. Flew the same route with Qatar Airways a few months before and they were quite simply in a different league. One last note, you build this terminal 5 which is meant to be ""world class"". Firstly there is no smoking area, although we're constantly being told not to smoke many people still chose to. You expect people to wait in your terminal for hours on connections and we can't even enjoy a fag in the process though it seems the toilets are an unofficial smoking area as you're normally met with a wall of smoke when you walk in. I am not someone who can walk into an airport and buy a Rolex and a Gucci outfit, like most people.

BA shined post-flight,T Smythson,23/04/2017,United States,"  World Traveler Plus from Heathrow to SFO. The only whinge we had with the experience is that the new entertainment system had to be re-booted.  Boarding was pretty much average, with no zone boarding for economy, just everybody get on.  First time in Premium Economy, and we loved it. Where BA shined was post-flight. I did the unforgivable and walked off with the wrong checked bag.  Discovered it 3 hours drive later. Got contacted by staff at BA luggage, and in spite of the mess being entirely my fault, immediately volunteered to FedEx overnight my bag to me.

warned that BA had gone downhill,Ivan Sterdza,22/04/2017,Italy,"  Buenos Aires to London. I was warned that BA had gone downhill, but I decided to give it a try on this long haul flight. To start with, you cannot reserve your seat prior to check-in, unless after paying over 2000€ for a business class ticket you are willing to spend some additional 90€ per leg to have your seat reserved. I call this insane, to be honest. So I waited and waited and waited till check-in opened, and made it to get a forward facing aisle seat. LATAM Lounge in Buenos Aires was nice, food average but connecting from Santiago I had the time to take a shower, with ground crew extremely nice and attentive. Boarding was sort of a mess, as BA let frequent flyers (not flying Business) board through the Business class door, so there was a flood of people moving back and forth to get to the rear of the plane; crew simply unable to handle this process, so you did not feel like being taken care of during boarding. Aircraft was a 3-class Boeing 777-300 and looked a bit ""tired"". Seat was the absolute worst part of this flight, as it is narrow, too hard to have a nice sleep, and for aisle passengers this configuration feels like having a ""wall"" on one side and being exposed to people/trolleys passing through the aisle on the other side; once flat it is a little short too (even for me, I'm 180cm high, no giant here) and narrow so you find yourself forced to sleep on a side; in addition to that when you lie down the drawer is not accessible, therefore you have literally no space to store anything, not even your glasses if you wear them. Food was just ok (I still can't understand how BA can run out of entrée options in Business class), crew very mature for such a long trip but friendly and nice, it really shows they are suffering from these cost cuts as they keep apologizing for everything that is not available or not working. Entertainment system made me smile a bit, as the selection of movies was ok but the screen was much smaller than some other carrier Economy class ones. To sum up, it was an average flight, if it was not for the lie-flat seat I would call it more a Premium Economy experience than a Business one. BA needs to improve Business class as they are well below par if compared to almost all European carriers, not even to compare the Middle East airlines.",Boeing 777-300,Business,Business Class,Buenos Aires to London,01/04/2017,no,Verified,1,2,4,3,4,3,3
a high cost no frills airline,G Rawson,21/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Pisa. Check in at Gatwick a breeze. Chaotic boarding process though. Flight took off approximately 10 minutes late. The cabin crew were exceptional and are one thing that BA have going for them. Middle seat vacant in business class but in reality no extra leg room in the seats and if the passenger in front decides to recline you have even less room. As for the catering. BA are getting this wrong. Why are they insisting on dumbing down on their once reasonable standards. I hardly call 'cheese on toast' a satisfactory meal choice. Despite calling it Croque Monsieur it is still cheese on toast what ever way you look at it ! I hope Mr Cruz reads these reviews. It is not what the customer wants. BA are turning into a high cost no frills airline. So much for their motto 'To fly to serve'.

how things have changed,B Parkes,21/04/2017,Germany," Stuttgart to London with British Airways. How things have changed. Passengers now queue at gate as with easyJet or Ryanair, rather than sitting and waiting to be called. Unsurprisingly, boarding in Stuttgart by agency staff was chaotic - unsure who was entitled to what. Cabin crew increasingly young and inexperienced, probably because older members have left in view of the transformation of British Airways to a budget airline. How visible this was! Few people bothered to purchase the over-priced snacks and drinks on offer. Once that was out of the way, the three cabin crew members gathered in the rear galley, chatted, and munched away at the spare food from the Business Class section which had been surreptitiously taken to the rear. At the rear I noticed that one of the two lavatories for Economy Class has now been ripped out and replaced by two seats without window. Directly opposite the one remaining toilet those passengers looked particularly unhappy - not least because of the constant queues alongside them. Everything about British Airways now is shabby, telling passengers how little they are valued. And this does not even mention the extra costs for hold luggage and for seat reservations. My ticket theoretically gave me a choice of seat, but at the appointed time there were only four choices left. So, no, I won't be flying them again unless all other options fail.",A319,Business,Economy Class,Stuttgart to London,01/04/2017,no,Verified,2,2,1,1,1,1,-1
BA should wake up,1 reviews,21/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  Flew Nice to Gatwick. £3.00 for a sandwich in Club Class. We travel in business class, whether long haul or in Europe, for a better experience. This is even more important now, since the quality of service in economy has nosedived under the 'stewardship' of Señor Cruz. It started badly when we discovered (once more) that the flight was not at the terminal, but in a remote location that required much waiting on a bus, just like a charter flight. I asked a staff member why this was so, to be told that the terminal was too small to cope, but I noticed low cost carrier Norwegian was parked on a jetty. We had booked seats in the second row as we wanted a choice of hot meal - those at the rear of Club often have no option due to catering limitations. Passengers were offered a choice of a curry, I think (yum) or salmon (yuck). By the time the nice crew got to us only salmon was left. This is high in potassium, a fish I must avoid. I asked why the other dish had run out by the second row? ""Only two were loaded"", was the reply. ""What; two only, for the whole of Club?"". ""Yes"". I asked what else was on board, only to be told that I would have to pay £3 for an M & S sandwich from economy. Before some help from our Avios, the tickets cost £500.00. It was beyond belief that an Executive card holder should be treated this way. The (very nice) cabin crew were excruciatingly embarrassed. BA should wake up before once loyal passengers swallow hard (pun) and migrate to other carriers. I'd rather fly easyJet and spend the £300 change on a nice meal.",A319,Family Leisure,Business Class,Nice to Gatwick,01/03/2017,no,Verified,6,2,4,1,3,1,-1
crew very polite and helpful,T Martin,20/04/2017,United Kingdom," London LGW to Lima. Booked to fly out in Premium Economy and back in Business overnight. I like BA’s website that allows you split classes like this. In the event got upgraded to Business both ways. No idea why. I am not a frequent flyer. Flights left and arrived on time. (Gatwick’s Sunday morning check in scrum is awful). All BA cabin crew and ground staff very polite and helpful. Food very good outward. Slightly poorer quality of meat on return but that will be the Peru catering supplier. Cabin clean, but plastic partitions and carpets are looking a bit tired. IFE screens are old and small. Plane was G-YMMS, both ways. Hate the BA penny pinching that even when you have paid £1600 they still want another £60 to pick a seat.",Boeing 777-200ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London LGW to Lima,01/04/2017,yes,Verified,2,5,5,4,5,4,3
if possible never fly BA again,Richard Turnley,20/04/2017,Dominican Republic,"  Punta Cana to Gatwick return. I would really like to say a good thing about my recent two flights with BA but can find nothing. The layout of the business class cabin is so bad with half the seats facing backwards that you have someone staring at you when the little divider is not up, the seats are extremely narrow that you cannot easily turn when they are in the sleep position and they are so low that it is almost impossible to get up from them. In more than 50 years of traveling, I have not been in a worse business class. The selection of films and music is limited and the screen small. The food on the two trips was passable but nothing more and the wines less than passable unless you like plonk. I do not suppose it is much fun for the flight attendants to work in such a low class environment but they did not one thing more than was absolutely necessary, I have saved the best for last because on the return flight the temperature of the cabin was close to freezing and I wore two pullovers and a blanket and was still cold. I know that many former BA customers have been bemoaning the fall in standards aboard and I regret that I join that group that will, if possible never fly BA again.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Punta Cana to Gatwick,01/04/2017,no,Verified,1,1,1,1,4,2,1
full service or a low cost,L Raymer,19/04/2017,United States,"  Washington to London Heathrow return. British Airways seems to be having an identify crisis. Are they a full service or a low cost carrier? The meals have been cut back to almost nothing. Seat selection fees abound. And checked baggage fees may apply, depending upon the the type of ticket purchased. United Airlines now has a better trans-Atlantic coach product than BA. Food: On the outbound overnight flight, breakfast has been reduced to a granola bar. On the return flight, dinner was tiny. Small amounts of food in half-filled bowls, presented on a large tray, as if to emphasize the lack of food. And the pre-landing snack has been replaced with the aforementioned granola bar. Given the lack of food, BA should just switch to buy-on-board, so at least fewer people would go hungry. Flight crews seemed apologetic about the lack of food. Seat fees: I don't know of any other ""full service"" carrier that will not assign a seat in advance as part of a paid ticket. Just assume it will cost you another $40 or more per ticket on BA. Luggage fees: Completely opaque policy. On our outbound trip, we were told our tickets included one free checked luggage item. On our return we were told checked bags would be extra, although the kindly baggage check-in attendant waived the fee for us (no doubt, he too is as much a victim of BA's indecipherable baggage fee policy as are passengers). Entertainment: Boeing 777-200 outbound with good, modern, on-demand IFE system. On the return a Boeing 747-400, the system was an older on-demand system, with small blurry screens that were almost unwatchable. Cabin crews were generally friendly. In fairness, both our flights were on time and nothing went wrong. But BA just feels cheap and stingy. Will likely fly the competition in the future.",Boeing 777-200 / 747-400,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Washington,01/04/2017,no,Verified,2,3,4,1,3,3,3
attendants were very attentive,Antony Vaughn,19/04/2017,United States,"  New York JFK to London Heathrow return. My review is based on three different criteria: Service, food, and seat comfort. Overall the service was very good. The flight attendants were very attentive throughout the flight, and very professional. Any request was handled in a timely manner. The flight was full, but service did not suffer. The food on the flight was absolutely disgusting and inedible. A choice of thai vegatable curry, or a chicken dish which I ate one bite of. The highlight of the meal was the two bite chocolate granache. Also, they have eliminated the second meal/snack service - all they served was tea/coffee and a cookie. Very poor indeed. Seat comfort was the best I've experienced in economy. I managed 4 hours of sleep on a 7 hour crossing. The slideable headrests allow your head not to bob. If not for the disgusting food i would give a 9/10.",Boeing 747-400,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to New York JFK,01/04/2017,yes,Verified,1,5,4,1,4,4,4
nearly 2 hours to be served,S Dramesch,19/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  Malaga to Gatwick. The seat had barely any legroom and it reclines only 1 or 2 degrees - impossible to relax. Food and drinks (including coffee and water) are now being charged and the airline only provides one trolley for whole plane. We were sitting in row 28 (of 30) and it took us nearly 2 hours to be served and only cards are accepted, which makes things worse. Appalling.

fantastic staff at Terminal 3,R Battisloe,19/04/2017,Norway,"  Stavanger to Las Vegas via London Heathrow. This is a salute to the fantastic staff at Terminal 3 helping my group out when everything seemed lost, because of American Airlines terrible customer service. The trip was originally meant to be a codeshare where we flew with BA booking under AA flights from LHR to LAS via JFK. The trip took place on April 3rd 2017 We risked being stranded with 16 out of 19 travelers at LHR, because of AA somehow ""magically"" losing our itineraries and not interested at all in helping, rather blaming everyone else. The BA service personnel spent hours trying to solve it, and  decided to take matters in their own hands. They got us 16 travelers on their direct flight from LHR to LAS the day after, arranging for accommodation, transport to/from the airport and Dinner / Breakfast, even though AA was mainly responsible for our journey. The service on-board was to expect from a economy flight of that duration. Seats was good, food all right, complimentary drinks and very welcome. The IFE was great, the screens was a little small compared to other newer aircraft's for this type of long haul, but no particular issues.",Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Stavanger to Las Vegas via London,01/04/2017,yes,Verified,1,4,4,3,5,4,4
nothing more than no-frills airline,David Taylor,18/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Rome return. Outward flight the plane was full. Booked and paid for an aisle seat, but no legroom and narrow seat. Did not eat on the aircraft. Landed on time. Return flight left Rome late, again full. This time I booked and paid for aisle seat near emergency exit - more leg room. Food on the plane was from M&S. Chose the ploughmans option having looked at the glossy catalogue. The food bore little resemblance to the photograph - dry and not filled. I feel sorry for the cabin crew as it takes them ages to serve the food, receive payment (you can't use cash) and then clear it all up. Passengers near the rear of the aircraft would be lucky to be served. British Airways European flights are nothing more than a no-frills airline.

I am ever increasingly disappointed,R Moody,18/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  London to Istanbul. I am ever increasingly disappointed with British Airways, the constant penny pinching is having a material affect not only on the hard product but the staff who seem dispirited. The seats, lounge food, aircraft cleanliness, on board food and beverages all are sub par compared to rival airlines. My most recent flight back I took an aisle seat for a change. The flight was quite full and there are a constant stream of people from the economy cabin coming through the business class cabin to use the toilets. This is really quite irritating especially during meal service. No attempt was made by the crew to stop this or even close the curtain splitting the cabins even after complaints. I find the aircraft consistently dirty and on this flight someone had left chewing gum on the seat as well. I think BA don't care, on the flight from Istanbul, electronic devices are banned, other airlines allow them up to boarding and then arrange for them to be taken off you. British Airways has not even bothered to offer entertainment, or even extra magazines on the flight. They really don't appear to give any care for their passengers even those flying business class.",A320,Business,Business Class,LHR to IST,01/04/2017,no,Verified,2,1,1,1,1,3,1
I won't be flying BA anymore,A Stewart,17/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  Los Angeles to London Heathrow. I have to agree with all the other reviews on here. BA have gone so far in cost cutting that the service the flight attendants are able to offer is just appalling. There's just nothing positive left to say about them. From the newly refurbished 747 that looks drab and cramped with the new uncomfortable slimline seats, to the disgusting cheap meals. The flight attendants were pleasant but you can see they're embarrassed and have nothing to offer. All this would be fine but British Airways still charges premium prices and for what? I just took a flight on the same route with Virgin Atlantic and what a difference! All the little extras that make long flights bearable are still there and the prices are cheaper. I'm afraid to say I won't be flying BA anymore unless it's to use up avios I'd acquired!",Boeing 747-400,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to London Heathrow,01/02/2017,no,Verified,1,1,3,1,3,1,2
charged me for a bottle of water,Ed Postal,17/04/2017,United States,"  London to Milan Linate. I landed in London after taking connecting flights from Orange County California to Dallas and then Dallas to London both on American. I landed in London at 1:15 P.M. This flight did not leave until 6:30 P.M. I went to the British Airways help desk and asked if I could get on the 3:00 flight. They told me to go to the gate and wait to see how full the flight was before the flight as I had only one carry one and nothing checked. I went to the gate just before boarding and they told me that it was impossible as I would have had to go to the ticket area at least an hour before to change the ticket. So I had to wait another 3 hours. I have now been traveling for 18 hours. At the gate for boarding they looked at the bag and said I would have to check it. I explained that it is a regulation carry on bag and it was on the last two flight and I have had the same bag on over 30 flights as carry on. I explained that it was on the last to connecting flights and I have been traveling for a long time and did not want to wait a long time for my bags as I will be getting in late. They were very rude and tagged the bag but still gave it to me to carry down to the tarmack and get on the bus to the plane. I decided to carry it on to the plane. It fit easily in the overhead as it has for every other flight (there were other bags that were bigger than mine. They actually came on the plane and took the bag off and put in in the cargo hold. If that wasn't annoying enough, I could not believe I asked for water to take a pill and they charged me for a bottle of water. They also charged the woman next to me for a cup of tea. I could understand this possible on one of the discount airlines but this was British Airways. To end my frustration it took almost an hour to get my bag as the belt stopped halfway through the process.

Excellent service and food,E Rubin,16/04/2017,Bulgaria,"  A business class sale convinced me to give it a try on a trip home from Sofia to Boston. I have to say that my wife, daughter and I were completely pleased, somewhat surprisingly so. Quick efficient checkin at the business class counter in Sofia. Decent contract lounge. Excellent service and food onboard both the Club Europe flight to London and Club World flight to Boston. Terrific flight attendants, and much better food than I am used to on United, LH or Austrian. I have a gluten allergy and need to order special meals. All three gluten free meals on this trip were among the best I have had. All three included flavorful sauces, which is something LH always omits from its special meals. The Galleries lounge in the B satellite terminal was excellent. Not as much food on offer as in the LH and OS lounges, or even the new UA lounge at Heathrow T2, but it was quiet and comfortable. And we really liked the quirky Club World business cabin. The middle section is great for couples, every seat has a storage drawer and the entertainment system was solid. There were four toilets for business class. My only complaint: the outrageous policy that required me to pay to reserve seats together in business class. As the fight was not full, I probably could have gotten seats together at checkin, but I did not want to take the risk, and BA got additional revenue, which is obviously why they do it.",Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Business Class,Sofia to Boston via London,01/04/2017,yes,Verified,3,5,5,5,5,5,4
attendants were attentive,1 reviews,15/04/2017,China,"  An excellent experience on a roundtrip trip from Hong Kong to Copenhagen through London. Despite being in economy class, the flight attendants were attentive and also proactive (serving our needs before we even needed to ask). They were friendly and made us feel completely at home. The on-board entertainment selection was very extensive, with high-quality options (English and international movies of high caliber) and the screen interface was modern and easy to use. The seats on the flight from HKG-LHR on the Boeing 777-300ER were new, and much more comfortable than the average older seat. The pilot was incredibly descriptive of the flight path we were taking, and kept us up to date in terms of turbulence, arrival time, weather without being overbearing or overly disruptive. With regards to the pre-boarding/ground service, one of the check-in representatives went out of her way accommodating my boyfriend and I so that we could sit together and have a window seat (both of which were not available at check-in due to the fact that we had bought our tickets separately and had not selected seats beforehand). We really appreciated her willingness to look at what she could do to make our trip more pleasant. This was not my first time flying with British Airways, but it had been a long time since I last boarded a long-haul flight with them, and the trip exceeded my expectations.

BA have totally lost the plot,G Graham,14/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  Flew London Gatwick to San Jose Costa Rica. We have flown business on numerous occasions and have noticed the decline in British Airways. The service on this flight was appalling. Travelling as a couple we were sat in the centre seats which the cabin staff appeared to ignore when offering any of the cabin services i.e. drinks, towels etc.. the normal routine stuff. On too many occasions we had to request attention. Chosen meals were not available on both outward and return flights and we were sat in row 2 at the front of the service. Collection of waste items had to be requested. The galley kitchen was not restocked and by the end of the flight looked like a bomb site, no glasses or cups were available for even a glass of water. Cabin staff were noticeable by their absence during most of the flight. Hot towels will soon be the size of a postage stamp. Toilet bags are cheap. BA have totally lost the plot. They are no longer a premium service and Willie Walsh and Co. need to take a flight on Emirates, Qatar etc. to realise their failings. Business seating configuration is ridiculous. Passengers in the centre seats have to hurdle their way to the isle over the isle passengers legs. As part of the same trip we made domestic flights to connect. Again service is in reverse but the costs aren't. If BA wants to become a budget airline then they need to offer budget fares. I don't think they have a clue what they are doing. In future we will avoid them unless absolutely necessary. The only positive of the trip was the lounge at Gatwick.

want to be a no-frills airline,C Morgan,12/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  I had to change my flight back from San Diego because of an accident that required a stay in hospital. I'd flown out first class and had a business class return. I do understand why some fare structures mean that flights are not changeable, but BA were absolutely no help at all. They flatly refused to change the flight so I had to buy a ticket in the only available class - World Traveller Plus. Which cost $3,300 - one way. The first class fight to was OK - nice cabin crew and good food, but grubby cabin and clear cost cutting - no snacks, water etc in the galley like there used to be. Absolutely no help on the return trip - despite requests before the flight - because I was walking with a stick. I'd requested an aisle seat, had to ask again at check in as they had given me a seat in the middle which would have really annoyed other passengers as I tried to get across them to go to the loo etc with my stick. Really poor value at $3,300 and rubbish seats, uncomfortable and tv screens that aren't great. The food was awful - clear that costs are being cut massively. Maybe their plan is to offer such rubbish food that when they introduce food you have to buy in long haul we all feel grateful! It's a pity really. It's obviously BAs call if they want to be a no-frills airline, but I'd rather they were honest with us so that we can choose amongst the many other no frills airlines. But they keep trying to say that BA is a leading brand with strong values when clearly they've decided to cut costs wherever they can but still charge high prices.

don't go out your way to fly them,D Lewis,11/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  Philadelphia to Edinburgh via Heathrow in January 2017. I've always enjoyed flying British Airways and usually make my yearly trips to Philly with them rather than flying direct to Newark via United. The long haul flight was OK - food service was a wee bit slow but it was the usual chicken and rice which was OK for an economy class flight. However, it was a surprise to me that they no longer served breakfast or even a snack in the morning - so the chicken was the only food we got on the flight. I wasn't too fussed about that, until I got on my connecting flight to Edinburgh where I found out that they no longer served free food! By this point, I was pretty hungry so I caved in and got ready to pay for a bacon roll, which never happened because the trolly never reached me! To top it all off, we left Heathrow late because of a computer problem, meaning I missed my train connection in Edinburgh - but I understand that these things happen at times. However, recent cuts to service and the upcoming densification of the long and short haul fleet make BA a lot less attractive. Furthermore, the headphone jack on my IFE was loose so it was quite difficult to watch films during the flight, which was disappointing. On the up side, the staff both at the desk and during the flight were great as always. Considering I got the flight for a good price, it was OK. Although I will definitely not be going out my way to fly BA and will just go for the cheapest or direct option in future. I'm indifferent in recommending flying with BA - if they suit you best, then go ahead.

BA need to invest in a new fleet,1 reviews,11/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  Well where do you start. This is a business seat on a supposedly premium brand. The ticket price was in excess of £5000. The lounges at LHR T5 need work. Yes British Airways are investing but long overdue. The small lounge for B gates needs to be re-thought and offer better food options. To the aircraft - its been refitted apparently, but should be scrapped. The seats remain tired. The vanity screen was not working properly. The entertainment system is past its best, with smudges and scratches. The carpets look like they need a very good clean and are grubby indeed. The toilets are 'old'. Overall, the aircraft is well past what could be described as a premium. Regarding the crew - they have been bashed and are a shadow of their former selves. Sad but true. Too many apologies for the rubbish decisions of management. On this trip the galley kitchen was poorly stocked and many of the usual items were missing e.g. Waitrose fruit and yogurts. They have also stopped the ice-cream. Food served was not good - saving grace was the meat platter, but what could you do to spoil sliced meats and cheese. Blankets are faded and ragged. The toilet bags are a joke. Cheap and nasty. This route was the jewel in the airline crown and one that has slide down the priority ladder. BA need to invest in a new fleet. Re-energise the crew.

legroom is an absolute joke,Adrian Beck,09/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  Just got off the flight from Heathrow to New Orleans and have to say it was one of the worst long haul economy class flights I have ever had to endure. The legroom is an absolute joke for such a long flight - first time I have ever been unable to open my laptop to work (I now understand why they don't offer wifi on board!). The seats are minuscule and if you are unfortunate to be sitting next to somebody who is rather big boned shall we say, then it is a dreadful experience. In my section one of the toilets was not working from the start of the flight and the other toilet rapidly descended into a disgrace with no cleaning done throughout the flight. I have travelled a lot over the years, first, business and economy, and had a gold British Airways card, but this was just terrible and I don't really know what BA hope to achieve in the long run - I can guarantee, I will seek other airlines first before considering them again.

being turned into Vueling,Kathleen Kirby,09/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  We flew on a reward flight from London Heathrow to Brussels for a weekend and decided to treat ourselves to a full service experience.  We were very well looked after by superb flight attendants who had a great sense of humour. The lunch was chicken salad and a nice dessert. What we did notice is that the legroom was just the same as economy, and seemed rather worse than usual. The only perk we had was a blanked off seat in the middle, which, if you are a bit chunky like me, it was quite difficult to manoeuvre. This all tallies with what has been written in the newspapers, and we, like many other reviewers and frequent loyal flyers feel that BA is being turned into Vueling. If it weren't for the excellent pilots and flight attendants on BA who make our journeys feel very comfortable and safe, we would not travel on BA.

Between breakfast and lunch there is no hot food. Unused hot food is removed at 9.30am sharp. Why not leave it ??? So all you have is bread and stodgy croissants. The upstairs of the A380 was in need of a serious clean. Cabin crew friendly, although you can sense lower morale. BA flights are often late now in my experience. The Club World A380 seats aren't comfortable. Despite everyone knowing, crossing over someone's legs too get out is still a nuisance. There is a scrum it down for last use of toilets before landing - I had one bloke shout at me when I'd been waiting long before him and he'd just turned up and tried to arrogantly barge in.

turning BA into a low-cost carrier,R Thomas,07/04/2017,Germany,"  I am just sad to have to write this review. I changed from Lufthansa to British Airways more then 10 years ago, because it beening a premium airline that was superior in any way. Mostly flying between Berlin, the US and in recent years very frequently Cape Town. BA had more modern planes, innovative products like a great (rather new) First Class, lie-flat seats in Business Class, a new premium economy and a very good economy with good seats and legroom. Flying from Cape Town to Berlin in January to keep my Silver Status made me realise, that none of my initial reasons to choose BA still exists, with the exception of the great cabin staff, that I feel really sorry for. The owners hired Álex Cruz last year, a very experienced low-cost airline executive and he is doing the best he can: Turning BA into a low-cost carrier. Unfortunately. The result is a pity. No more service on short haul flights, reduced service, only paid snacks on long-haul, worn 747's to Cape Town and the grimm outlook to be traveling in cramped in 777's with and extra seat squeezed in from next year onwards. British Airways as a premium airline is lost. Realistically for year to come. Even with my status renewed, I don't think I will fly them again if I don't have to. Meanwhile I understand, that companies sometimes unterstand and correct their mistakes. I do hope BA will do so in the hopefully not to distant future - and keep their great staff on ground and on board.",Boeing 747,Business,Premium Economy,Cape Town to Berlin via London,01/01/2017,no,Verified,1,3,5,1,3,1,2
service inevitably snail-paced,O Francis,07/04/2017,United Kingdom," No, no, no, British Airways. You've messed up. Someone sat in an office thought it would be a good idea to charge for food and drink on flights, just like many other airlines do, and they said ""Let's provide food from M&S: that will make our offering classier than the rest."" The problem on my 18:55 flight from Marrakech to London was that — it being dinner time — loads of passengers wanted food and drink, so the service was inevitably snail-paced. A piece of friendly advice, BA, you need to provide 4 cabin crew to handle economy on a dinnertime flight, or you merely annoy your customers. Sitting near the back of the plane, my wife and I got served 2 hours into the 3.5 hour flight, by which time our tongues were hanging out. But what's this? Only two sandwiches left, and we bagged the last two packets of crisps. You're promising things you can't deliver, BA. There is such as thing as advertising standards, and your beautifully photographed food and drinks menu drives a coach and horses through the principles of advertising standards. The 2 cabin crew serving economy soldiered on with their service most impressively, even managing to smile as for the umpteenth time someone's payment card failed to register on their machine. (Hint for frequent flyers: if your card just doesn't work you get your food and drink for free.) Meanwhile, behind the service trolley, a phalanx of passengers with their legs tightly crossed tried to avoid exhorting the cabin crew to move their trolley so they could access the toilets to relieve themselves (a very appropriate expression in the circumstances). Other passengers simply wanted to relieve themselves of the packaging of the food they bought hours earlier: several of them eventually came down the aisle waving their empty bottles and M&S extensive food packaging for the crew to remove from their sight. Whoever at British Airways is employed to read reviews on this website, please take note and pass it on to your management if you dare. The process I call 'Ryanisation' of British Airways is almost complete. You now charge for checked baggage (yes, I know that's indirect, but only idiots can't see through the scam), you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to be tall, and who need the legroom of emergency exit seats, and now you've devised a marvellous system of charged cabin service for food and drink on 'short haul' (what even BA used to call 'medium haul') flights that annoys more than half the customers on board the plane. Oh, and by the way: why don't the cabin crew deploy the A320 overhead monitors that display the flight progress? Too costly, perhaps? I suggest that BA needs to return to the days of advertising when you had a wonderful slogan, but with a minor revision: ""British Airways, the world's least favourite airline"".",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Marrakech to London Gatwick,01/04/2017,no,Verified,8,3,1,1,3,3,-1
BA is now a no-frills carrier,J Egleton,06/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Munich return. It used to be an enjoyable experience flying BA. Sadly all the cutbacks are kicking in now, and travelling BA just feels like a bit of a chore. The loss of the free bar/food service on European flights is a real step down. Even worse is the cynical way in which it happened: downgrading the food offering so much that it seemed like an 'improvement' to offer paid-for M&S food on board. Oh, and how replacing my free drink with the same drink, only now I have to pay, is an 'improvement' in service is beyond me. Not even a free tea or bottle of water? (I asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying, only to find it tasted of chlorine - wouldn't recommend you do the same). The 'card-only' payment system is chaos as well, it takes forever for the trolley to get from one end of the plane to the other. Next on the list is the outrageous prices that BA charge to select a seat in advance. Not wishing to pay this, by the time I checked in for this flight (the maximum 24 hours in advance) there were only 5 or 6 seats on the whole plane I could choose from. I took the sole window seat available right at the back of the plane, which is far from my first choice of seat. Other carriers let you select seats at check-in for free, and EasyJet charge about half of what BA charge to select the equivalent seats in advance (and if you pick one of the 'preferred' seats with EasyJet, you also get priority check-in and boarding for your money - not so with BA). Check-in at T5 was also a hassle on this occasion as the first check-in machine wouldn't work at all, and the second printed a boarding pass but wouldn't let me print a bag tag. So I couldn't use the bag drop counters after all and had to queue up at the check-in desks, wasting time. There was a minor delay due to fog, but that wasn't BA's fault and didn't have a hige impact. Flight itself was pretty smooth and cabin crew were good. On the way back, our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real 'pro' to flying BA in Europe with standard economy fares - the ability to switch between flights for free on-the-day. Could we? No, the earlier flight was full. Rather than sit in Munich airport all afternoon, we rebooked on Lufthansa instead. In summary, if flying BA on European routes these days, be aware that BA is now a no-frills carrier. Lower your expectations to this level, and you'll probably have a pleasant flight.",A320,Business,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Munich,01/03/2017,no,Not Verified,5,3,3,1,3,3,1
the worst flight I've been on,Andy Magowan,05/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  Belfast to Gibraltar via Heathrow return. I fly British Airways when I can and have always been impessed and satisfied - until now. The flight from Heathrow to Gibraltar was uneventful, clean aircraft, no delays, no issues - apart from the lack of drinks / snacks. I'd love to know who thought this would be a good idea. Flying short haul, there is nothing to differentiate BA from easyJet or other no frills airlines. Add to this the lack of choice on their ""menu"". There are only a couple of sandwiches, and if you don't like mayo or cheese, you're out of luck. Well done BA, you've alienated loyal customers and are hardly likely to attract new ones. The flight from Heathrow to Belfast is my main gripe. The flight was meant to depart at 1645, but was delayed to 1720, hardly a big deal right? Wrong! The gate only went up at 1650, this led me to a bus which took us to the aircraft. It was 1730 before everyone was boarded, again, hardly a big deal except that we didn't take off until 1830, which meant that my dogs had to spend an extra night in kennels as I was back too late to pick them up. The flight itself was full, which wouldn't have been too bad if there hadn't been a lady sitting a couple of rows in front of me who stank. I won't go into details, but she smelled rancid. I was a few rows back and so didn't get the worst of it, but I could see others who were closer who were not having a good time at all. Needless to say I didn't enjoy the flight at all. I would go so far as to say that it's probably the worst flight I've been on, and I've flown Monarch and easyJet. I did e-mail BA with my concerns, but they didn't bother to reply. So, again, well done BA, you're squandering customers good will toward you like you're burning fifty pound notes.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Belfast to Gibraltar via Heathrow,01/04/2017,no,Verified,1,2,3,1,3,3,-1
have slipped significantly,28 reviews,03/04/2017,Australia," London to New York. It has been a long time since I have been on a British Airways flight and time has not been kind. T5 at LHR is cavernous and reasonably easy to navigate once you work out where things are. It just feels a bit hit and miss compared to Changi or HK. The flight itself was on an old B747. New seating and IFE but very old. The boarding process was chaotic. Extra security checks at the gate itself, hardly surprising. Seat comfort was ok albeit very tight and narrow. The IFE was great and that was the highlight. The lunch served was so so, but having eaten at the lounge, it was left largely uneaten. The biggest problem is the staff morale. They all seemed to be keen to get the service out of the way, dim the lights and disappear. Evidence of cost cutting in that water was only provided if asked for, any wine was by the glass, very cheap cutlery etc. BA is a premium airline but looks to be offering a Ryanair standard. Compared to the ME or Asian or my usual ride, Qantas, BA have slipped significantly.

expect you to pay to reserve seats,Richard Holt,02/04/2017,United Kingdom,"  Flight from Gatwick to Grenada return with British Airways. Lounge in south terminal was good flight and staff were good, decent food and the plane was clean. What I struggled to get my head around is after paying for business class flights, BA then expect you to pay an additional £77 per person each way to reserve seats. There were 4 of us traveling so that adds in excess of £600 to our flight cost. BA will tell you that this is free 24 hours before departure but actually 3 days before departure most seats had gone. I would expect after paying for business class that you automatically get seated together but it appears not, as there was one couple on the return flight who had not reserved seats after paying for business class and were made to stand in the galley until everybody had boarded to if there were 2 seats together.",Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Business Class,Gatwick to Grenada,01/03/2017,no,Verified,1,5,5,4,5,1,4

British Airways never fails in terms of being on time, but I will end my business with them after more then 30 flights and having said very good things about them in the past. They seem to be cutting corners with everything, passengers are not given even a small cracker and for some strange reason the plane does not stop at the hub, just goes to a remote stand and takes forever to get to the terminal.

atrocious customer service,G Stainer,29/03/2017,Australia,"  I was scheduled to fly BA208 from Miami to London on January 18th. Boarding and departure went normal, but than, close to take-off, the ordeal began. Captain announced a technical problem (at approx. 09:15 pm) and that's when the horror started. Overall, we ended up sitting in the plane until 01:00 am before we were finally allowed to leave the plane (any attempts to fix the fault failed). We were given accomodation, but that was a 45 mins drive from Miami Airport. Check-in took another 30 mins due to a long queue of stranded passengers, and the place was like a freezer. Was re-booked for a flight the next day, but downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy. Old, tatty 747, very uncomfortable seat and entertainment screen was the size a mobile phone. Worst of all, the delay of one day has forced me to add another night in London, and cancel my connection to Munich. Total additional expenses, not counting the difference between Premium Economy (which I paid for) and Economy was ~$500. Including the gap between Economy and Premium Economy probably ~$900. Now this is where a service oriented company would have an opportunity to make a difference. Submitted my compensation claims incl. proof for the above expenses, as per protocol online - no confirmation. Followed up with a call (had to wait approx. 45 mins to talk to a human) and was told that most expenses are not refundable but I would be compensated for the remaining. No further confirmation, email etc. Was paid a mere $50 into my account with no explanation what this is supposed to be for (the expenses were $900). Decided to do some research and it appears that under EU law, airlines are required to compensate for consequential damages if the delay if more than 3 hours (my delay was 21 hours).

very lazy and oblivious staff ,Ashley Mayes,29/03/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Los Angeles. Worst flight ever with British Airways, you can see why they have fallen out of the top 10! Very lazy and oblivious staff members. They ran out of food during both meal times. We were promised a replacement but nothing came until they cleared away the trays. All we got was ""oh sorry"" and a re-re heated meal. After leaving the service light on for 15 minutes looking for some water, I went to the back of the plane to find 2 members of staff reading the paper. Even after complaining to customer service after the flight we weren't treated much better.

staff were absolutely appalling,Peter Sharp,27/03/2017,United Kingdom,"  I have never had such a bad experience with British Airways before. The cabin staff were rude, lazy and obviously did not want to provide a service. The flight was from Mauritius to Gatwick on Sunday 26th March 2017 landing Monday morning 27th March. No second cup of coffee offered at breakfast, we had to take our own plates back before landing and on two occasions the steward pointed to a cloth on the floor and expected me to pick it up without a please or a thanks. Food was good, the staff were absolutely appalling.

has really gone downhill,P Cleare,27/03/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Hong Kong. The new premium economy seat is a vast improvement on the previous seat, but I was hugely disappointed however with the inflight offering. For a 13 hour flight in a Premium Economy I would have assumed it would be similar to others offering, meals, mid flight snacks and other bits. I was very wrong. We had a bar service and meal, there was then nothing until breakfast (exactly the same as the Economy offering). This is appalling, British Airways has really gone downhill with its measly service offering. I went to speak the crew at the rear of the aircraft, they completely understood customer frustrations, they just have nothing to give. BA was once a carrier you looked forward to flying with. Not so much anymore. The crew were friendly but even they seem to have lost the passion they once had.

On the return flight, we were 2 flight attendants down due to the strike, but they were excellent and more than made up for the missing staff. I know that there has been a lot of gripes about BA downgrading its services, but these flights were really good, and that there were lots of drinks runs during the sleep time.

second rate budget airline,27 reviews,25/03/2017,United Kingdom,"  
London Heathrow to Edinburgh on British Airways domestic economy, check in at T5 okay although a little slow fast track security quick. I used the BA Galleries North lounge which was full but okay with hot food on offer in the mid afternoon. Boarding through A8 on to a clean looking full A319. I had seat 25A which has no window. Crew where actually very friendly as is normally the case on BA. Not a very pleasant flight due to turbulence but landed just about on time baggage off quickly so flight not too bad. The footnote to this trip is really my feelings towards BA. In order to maintain my Executive club silver status (Oneworld Sapphire) I have to take 4 BA flights each year, which I can do on domestic routes but the additional 16 or so European and International flights I take each year will be either with other Oneworld carriers or others and not BA. The management at British Airways are making false claims, when suggesting ""it's what our passengers asked for"". I travelled with BA 16 times last year and I wasnt asked if I wanted a devaluation of the BA Executive Club - or was I asked if I wanted to pay a huge extra charge to book specific seats - I most certainly was never asked if I wanted the simple snack and a coffee on UK and European flights replaced by buy your own food - neither was I asked if I mind paying for snacks on International flights.

worst short haul flight ever,Mike Palmer,24/03/2017,Canada,"  Toronto to Berlin via London on miles in a mix of classes. First class check in at Toronto was good with friendly staff. A fast priority security lane had me in the first lounge in 15 mins. Unfortunately first lounge was full (of gold card members) and so had to sit in the Biz lounge. Good menu to eat on the ground and decent selection of wine and beers. Fast boarding once it started and greeted at the door and taken to 2A. Excellent rose champagne served by friendly and professional crew. A weird but tasty starter of a cured / dried salmon followed by steak which was well cooked. Good cheeses and all courses selected were available. After some decent sleep, a fast breakfast served as late as possible ended a decent flight. T5 North lounge was packed with a 20 min wait for a shower which are now looking tatty and dirty. Decent breakfast selection of hot rolls, fruit, cereals etc. Quick board for the flight to Berlin. Ridiculous leg room -at 30 inches max. Very cramped. Don't like the table in the middle and several couples asked for them to be removed. An ok snack of cold meats though stingy portions. On time arrival and fast bags finished off a good and cramped outward leg. Returning to London in economy was possibly the worst short haul flight ever (including low cost airlines). A full A321 was cramped, insufficient bins (with one out of service) and the now infamous terrible leg room.(I understand this is to get even worse when BA moves to 180 pax on an A320 in line with charter and low cost carriers. Slow food and drink service with little take up. Some couldn't buy as no cash accepted. Not even juice, water and coffee offered for free. This penny pinching denying you even a glass of water makes the US and Canadian carriers look high class. The only saving grace were great crew who were embarrassed by the product they had to deliver. The whole plane looked fed up, subdued and just waiting for the hell to finish. Final leg to Toronto on a 777 included a bus mystery tour to a remote stand. Nice crew who were efficient and offered decent service. Poor lunch of roast chicken, weird mash and overcooked greens. Not Biz class food and pretty average. (more like economy food). Afternoon tea was fine, with a fast deplaning and bags. On the long haul legs, the IFE was identical to Christmas, poor choice, little new material - clearly even the IFE is now down graded. The biz class product - once cutting edge is in urgent need of a revamp if only to get rid of the 8 across and lack of privacy. How the mighty have fallen! Experiencing four classes on four legs, showed the gulf in all classes between BA and competitors on both short and long haul. The short haul legs to / from Berlin are worse than budget airlines where at least you know what you're getting and it's reflected in the fare and extras. With less leg room, fewer toilets, reduced quality and/or no refreshments, and a general downgrading of service, the only thing not reduced is the price. This suggests that the BA Exec and IAG only care about the bottom line and not the customer or reputation of a once world class airline. The only thing left to strip customers of is the Exec Club and Avios. It's only a matter of time before this final nail in the BA coffin hits the customer at which point - I'm off!

how much of a budget are they on now?,B Andrews,23/03/2017,United Kingdom,"  Heathrow Terminal 5 is a great airport, dedicated to British Airways, the check-in service was not as fast as they say, it was normal. The BA staff on the ground were cheerful and happy to help. I was very excited to fly on the new Dreamliner from London Heathrow to Dubai, but my dreams were crushed within my first few steps onboard. First the IFE felt very old and not clear at all, something you'd expect on non-refurbished B777's. Choice of movies and TV Shows are pretty good so I can't fault BA on that. The seats are nice, the head rest is excellent and leg room is okay. Cabin Crew are lazy and just do not want to serve us, I was waiting more than 7 minutes for someone to come to my bright light hovering above my head. The food is okay (Your first meal) its hot and options were good, two meats and nothing more you could ask for on a plane. However and this is a big however, your second meal we were given a Breakfast Bar, that was disgraceful! How much of a budget are they on now? I thought maybe something happened to the food so they gave us Breakfast bars instead, but on the return journey we were given a cookie for Lunch, people were laughing and looking at their cookies in disgrace. I just can't believe how downhill BA has gone. It's incredible how the airline now charges for shorthaul flights too, I think they're running out of money.

seats are narrow,David Taylor ,22/03/2017,United Kingdom,"  British Airways use a version of the 747 with a minimal number of economy seats on this route from London Heathrow to Johannesburg. Every seat on both outward and return flights was occupied. They make a bigger profit by having more seats in business class etc and so squeeze the economy class people into a confined area. Seats are narrow, seat cushions are hard, and I had a ""large"" person next to me both trips. I paid for an aisle seat in each case but comfort is impossible. Food was passable and no more, but there were two meals on the long flight. Cabin crew were surprisingly young and seem to be in training - polite and efficient but they had obeyed the instruction to disappear for most of both flights. Both flights on time. These ancient 747s are showing their age even though both of these had been ""revamped"" they looked tired but clean. The alternative aircraft used on this route is and airbus 380 but a fellow passenger said that the seats were even tighter on that aircraft.

I then had to cancel the outward trip for personal reasons and was charged extra to do so, so I ended up spending more on 1 flight than I had for 2. They now charge for food and drink on shorthaul flights, I even had to purchase a bottle of water. This is akin to a LCC such as Easyjet, but the fares are still much more expensive. In addition, I received an email from the airline saying they had tried to contact me and could I contact British Airways about my booking. I had received one missed call with no message during working hours. Having eventually dug out the right customer services number (these were not provided on the email) I tried several time to get through on but was left waiting so long I eventually gave up.",A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Toulouse,01/03/2017,no,Verified,2,2,1,1,2,1,-1
inflated prices for food,D Gordon,13/03/2017,United Kingdom,"  Edinburgh to Luanda via Heathrow.

 cutbacks are a cut too far,Pam Stephenson,11/03/2017,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Bridgetown. Firstly couldn't book myself in online - my husband had a reward flight and he was checked in but I couldn't move him, his seat was fixed. So we had to leave mega early so I could sit near him! Luckily got the seat behind him. Food and seats terrible. Tea time snack an insult, 2 small cookies. Breakfast was a muesli bar! I already have booked with BA again for Tampa but they are the only airline that fly there direct, however my annual flights to Barbados will be with Virgin in future. I have complained twice re check in, meals and the broken tray table on the return trip, and have been offered 5000 Avios points (£40) that just ties me into flying with them again, especially as they expire every year so will disappear before I might want to use them! The cutbacks are a cut too far BA.

not worth paying for business,Anastasia Therianou,10/03/2017,United Kingdom,"  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me.

not a business class product,1 reviews,09/03/2017,United Kingdom,"  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small.

will not be flying BA any more,C Newton,09/03/2017,United Kingdom,"  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed.

plane in both directions old and shabby,K Tatten,08/03/2017,United Kingdom,"  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route.",Boeing 747-400,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,LHR to YVR,01/03/2017,no,Verified,9,3,3,2,3,2,2
lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance,1 reviews,08/03/2017,United Kingdom,"  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Gibraltar,01/02/2017,no,Verified,1,3,2,1,2,3,-1
Inflight service was basic,Kah Kay Au,08/03/2017,Singapore,"  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class.

nothing short of chaotic,T Robinson,07/03/2017,United Kingdom,  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets.

British Airways have lost the plot,1 reviews,07/03/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent.

how the mighty have fallen,Geoffrey Wyndham-Jones,06/03/2017,Kuwait,"  Oh dear: cost-cutting on British Airways has led to them becoming an embarrassment. Flew Kuwait to Edinburgh via London. Aircraft are still comfortable, timekeeping is good, and information from the flight deck is always forthcoming. However, most of the cabin crew were ""mature"", and the food and drink offering is now minimal. Breakfast from Kuwait was eggs mixed with vegetables (no, not the omelette we used to have) plus mushrooms and potatoes both prepared as a mushy sort of tortilla: both looked like something you would spoon out of a tin for a baby. ""Lunch"" was a mars bar or similar. I did not bother with the ""buy on board"" stuff on the flight to Edinburgh - I get a better choice in the terminal when I get off the aircraft. The domestic flight back from Edinburgh to Heathrow had the most appallingly childish cabin crew I have ever seen on BA, giggling at each other during the safety demonstration - very unprofessional. The evening meal out of London back to Kuwait was more like a snack, with a smallish steak, three snap peas, three baby carrots (I counted the things), and another babyfood potato thing. ""Breakfast"" was a muesli bar. Sorry guys: a comment on this board that BA equals ""Budget Airline"" just about sums it all up. I have other choices from the Gulf back home, and next time I will be thinking about taking one of them: the only attraction with BA is the extra legroom in Premium Economy, the choice of entertainment, and the direct flight to Heathrow rather than having to fly down the Gulf and return. Otherwise, the epitaph ""how the mighty have fallen"" springs to mind.",Boeing 747-400 & A320/321,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Kuwait to Edinburgh via London,01/02/2017,no,Not Verified,6,5,3,2,5,3,5
Hopelessly inadequate product,Clive Drake,06/03/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow - Pisa return. I fly this route often as I have a house in Tuscany. I fly British Airways Club Europe only because the FAs are better, the lounge is a welcome benefit - and if you book far ahead enough - you can get a reasonable deal plus Avious points. That aside there is little benefits to flying say Ryanair. The trip started at T5 and the Northern lounge was not, for a change, to busy. Had a fruit and coffee breakfast. The options were a group of highly unhealthy looking bacon baps - dripping fat all over the place. Some years ago - BA provided some nice scrambled eggs. Now they don't. Flight left from the ""A"" terminal and we boarded ""downstairs"" from the lounge. The plane was half full. It was clean and valeted. We pushed back 10 minutes early. My wife had a sort of brunch thing, cheese and ham + rolls. She said it was ok. I had a couple of Gin and Tonics. The FA said she had never seen such an empty flight - and neither had I for that matter. The now chargeable food and beverages in Economy went down like a lead balloon apparently. I read the BA ""Brochure"" on the now chargeable food and as a Sales and Marketing professional - It was the most patronising piece of rubbish I'd ever read. It read as if BA were providing the most amazing product to the benefit of all. And goodness me - the products are not cheap - over a £1 for a kit kat. We landed ahead of time and has to walk the tarmac like Ryanair customers. Several years ago you had the air-bridge. Now you don't. The return flight started in the shared lounge which was rammed. This in part is due to Qatar airlines operating out of Pisa and their Business Class customers use the same facility. Some booze and snacks - nothing edible. Flight delayed by 30 minutes. Plane was rammed. Very pleasant FAs. Afternoon tea - with horrible dried out sandwiches + scones that didn't look like scones. On both flights - the usual three seats with the centre seat being a table. No legroom. Hopelessly inadequate product which can be as high as £600 return. Docked at the ""B"" terminal and had to walk miles to the trains - that took us back to T5/Terminal ""A"".

The starter of melon and cucumber was poor. The chicken main was overcooked and lacked any flavor. Drinks were good. Some options missing as not loaded but quality generally good.

We checked in or tried to check in, whereupon the discrepancy was brought to our attention. We couldn't prove we booked correctly or that a computer glitch was to blame we still had to get home. The staff tried in vain to change the ticket but were told by faceless managers, ""no nothing could be done"". We enquired the cost of two Economy seats home whereupon we told the two Economy tickets would come to an eye-watering $5092 or £4243 Economy. To add insult to injury we already had 1st class tickets booked that just needed to be re-booked to the 12th February, no chance. We had no choice (over a barrel) scarcity value I hear you cry, no. We boarded to find that the flight was less than half full. My wife and I were beside ourselves with anger (not to the flight crew) it wasn't their fault but they were dumbstruck themselves.

experience was wonderful,1 reviews,26/02/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Chicago O'Hare and my experience was wonderful. There were a few problems checking in at Terminal 5 (there was an issue with some of the luggage belts at check-in running slow - never mind these things happen). We were given information about what was happening and staff were doing their best. Fast-track security was fast. Made my way to the lounge in South Terminal which was busy but I was able to find a quiet spot. Lots of food and drinks on offer but I stuck to water as I knew would be eating on the plane. Had to go to a gate in B terminal - this was my first time at Terminal 5 so asked how to get to the gate, very easy instructions given and transportation via the transit train. Boarding was easy although I didn't use the priority boarding service (my bad missing the announcement). I paid extra so I could pre-book my seat (63J) on the upper deck and really glad I did. Our cabin crew were wonderful, so attentive and polite and nothing seemed any bother for them. The food was good for airplane food and the pink champagne was very nice! I managed to get a couple of hours sleep which is very unusual for me. There's lots of room and the upper deck is limited to a maximum of 20 passengers so it feels very private. The window seats have lots of storage but unless you are in 62 or 64 A/K you have to climb over your neighbour's foot stool/legs to get in and out of your seat. 63J is an aisle seat so less private but lots of room as it's by an exit door (ideal for anybody over 6ft). There is a long not too high drawer to place items (I put a pair of knee-length leather boots in there without any issue and there was room for more) and there's the overhead lockers.

a journey of disappointment,Nicola Beretta,25/02/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Mumbai. I've been a loyal BA customer for several years, but this was a journey of disappointment. I was late to the airport due to delays on the train line. Called customer services while on my way, and after 15min of wait I was told they couldn't do anything about it, but gave me the number of the airport. It was incorrect. At Terminal 5 I asked the attendant for help given the rush. He was quite rude and said I had to join the queue unless I was flying business. At the gate, we had a late boarding because 'the computer wasn't working'. I was flying premium economy and let me say, on this flight (BA0199) it is like the economy class of several other airlines.  Plus this 777 was in desperate need of a refurbishment. My headrest was hanging down the seat, the screen was filthy and its arm broken so it wouldn't stay in position. The flight attendant (who I never saw smiling for the entire flight) said he had reported it on the way in. I asked to change my seat. In my new seat the headphone audio had regular loud cracks and pops (it wasn't the headphones, I tried mine too). The entertainment system was poor. It started nearly an hour into the flight and stopped an hour before landing, plus the 'noise cancelling' headphones are NOT noise cancelling - try pulling the jack out and it doesn't make a difference. Overall a very poor experience, crowned by a terrible breakfast.

"dreadful, stressful experience",Ken Wilkins,24/02/2017,United Kingdom,"  San Jose Costa Rica to London Gatwick. We were firstly unable to get two seats together at online check-in. The next day at the airport we asked the clerk if we could have our seats together and he refused. I argued my case that we had paid a lot of money for these flights. After about ten minutes he showed the seating plan to his supervisor who immediately approved changing us to be seated together. I later found out the two BA employees, travelling either for free or at a drastically reduced rate had been given the seats originally and were eventually, after a great deal of argument moved. I have complained to BA and they have confirmed that this did indeed happen and will ensure it doesn't in the future. Next up we both had salmon and were both ill towards the end of the flight. My IFE didnt work, they offered to move me, ironically to swap with one of the BA employees but I declined as it defeated the object of wanting to sit with my wife. Choice of starter also not available but that was no big deal. Dreadful, stressful experience for people who'd paid a lot of money. Have been called by Customer Service who have offered us 10000 Avios as compensation, enough for a night at the Holiday Inn Express! Awful company to deal with, totally dismissive of customer need.

major issue is their penny pinching,J Laws,24/02/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Miami. I paid £50 extra for an exit seat - this is the best thing to do. Make sure you get the one closest to window, mainly because no-one stands there to stretch their legs etc. You get unlimited leg room and the ability to stand up and wander / stretch whenever you want, and it is good value on a ten hour flight. The seats on the A380 are narrow, the entertainment system the usual etc. The meals were fine. My major issue with British Airways economy is their penny pinching. You sit down, there is no welcome snack - you then have your meal and  seven hours later if you are hungry, you have to pay for basic snacks. It's ridiculous. On American Airlines they put out boxes of pretzels, biscuits etc which you can just help yourself to. If you have a diet coke, on American you get a full 330ml can, on British Airways you get the small version. There are so few differences flying in economy between different airlines, these things count.

rebrand to a budget airline,C Christodolou,24/02/2017,United Kingdom,"  Lisbon to London Heathrow. Now that BA have started charging for all food and drink on short haul flights, they might as well rebrand to a budget airline. Over the last few years, leg room across European flights (business and economy class) has decreased, to the point where it now practically the same as any budget airline. That said, it is in practice worse than budget airlines, because at least the main budget carriers have done the decent thing of removing the seat recline button, eliminating further discomfort. Even without the seat in front reclined, anyone taller than 5' 8"" will be packed in tightly on any European short-haul flight. The staff are friendly and polite. However, they are often struggling to pass through the whole economy cabin with drinks/food sales service, especially when the plane is full and the flight is under 2hours 30mins. This does not only result in thirsty / hungry customers, but also the almost permanent presence of the service trolleys in the aisle blocking access to the toilets. Business class (which I sometimes use) is offered a free meal and drinks, all of a reasonable quality. However, in terms of legroom / seat size there is no benefit compared to economy. The only reason I continue to fly BA is because I have fairly set routes and BA generally fly at times which suit me. Otherwise, I get little in the way of added value. The benefits of Avios points and moving up membership tiers are hardly worth it (in monetary terms), particularly if one mostly flies within Europe. It is much cheaper to get a lounge membership (many are valid for most European - and beyond - airports), rather than remain loyal to BA these days. I have been flying with BA for well over a decade now, on a monthly basis. My sympathies go to the staff, because I fear cost-cutting will get them next, which will no doubt be to the detriment of the high standards the crews maintain to this day.",A320,Business,Economy Class,Lisbon to London,01/02/2017,no,Verified,3,2,2,-1,3,2,-1
stay where British Airways used to be,25 reviews,23/02/2017,Germany,"  Berlin Tegel to London Heathrow. I decided to give British Airways a chance for a short weekend trip to London, because when it comes to prices they cannot beat the low-cost airlines. And what do you know? I had a part of the low-cost experience paying a bigger price: no checked-in luggage included (not even as a oneworld Emerald) and you had to pay for your inflight snacks and beverages. A plus is that the prices for the snacks and drinks were not as high as with other airlines that have introduced this service lately and the quality was good. The prices were even below airport ones. The bad thing was indeed that they needed a lot of time to deliver all the products (people were buying stuff) and it took ages until you could get your order - well, you can't compete with Ryanair trying to do better the things they do best. I really miss the days when British Airways was offering tea nad coffee for free and a little snack, it was a pleasure to fly with them and I would be happy to get back to those days. Some good things about the flights was that they landed ahead of schedule, boarding was very efficient, which is a big plus and the seats were gorgeous, a lot of space, very comfortable leather seats. As an advice, please don't try to be someone else, stay where British Airways used to be and the success will come.

the worst airline so far,S Hanylu,23/02/2017,Canada,"  Istanbul to London Heathrow. I am a frequent flyer between Turkey and Canada. I got first time flight by British Airways. I feel it was the worst airline so far compared to others. Can you imagine that they even did not give a cup of water to the passengers for 3.5-hour flight from Istanbul to London.  They explained it by economical concerns. What is the economical benefit not to serve a cup of water? Also, from London to Vancouver, we delayed almost 2 hours because of luggage issues and a passenger did not feel well and he had to leave the plane, which could be understandable this part.

British Airways First Class seat is barely a Business Class seat on other airlines. Food absolutely terrible, and service from crew hurried and disinterested. IFE movies limited selection, and slow. This is an airline in decline. They don't care because of limited competition across the Atlantic. In summary, not First Class, but rather no class.

I didn't expect great food or wine and was not disappointed. I didn't expect a comfortable economy seat and was pleasantly surprised. This was an older 777 with a 3-3-3 configuration (31"" seat pitch) in economy and comfortable seats. I flew to South Africa this time last year with Virgin on their new B787 and it was a nightmare.

decision to downgrade service,Mike Palmer,21/02/2017,Canada,"  Toronto to London in premium economy. Easy check in and fast track security meant I was in the lounge within 15 mins. Unfortunately, they were clearing up and restocking from the earlier flight. Poor choice of stale sandwiches and soup on it's last legs. I let the front desk know, and the staff made me a fresh sandwich. Also, beers had changed with 5 lagers and Newcastle Brown. The Manager fetched some IPA from the first lounge - some really good customer service which is typical in this lounge. The most disorganised boarding ever with few PAs. Onboard, juice or water offered. I asked for sparking wine but it's only done on flights from London - (crew explained it can't be chilled at outstations - (poor excuse given they do it for Club and First). Fast service after take off with an ok entree. Poor salad, and a nasty dry piece of cake. IFE was the same as my trip over Christmas so it seems the IFE is updated less often. Tea, coffee and juice offered before landing. But no muffin or even a biscuit - really poor. Prompt disembarking and bags beat me to the baggage belt. Return a week later was a better flight. Easy check in again and no fast track queue. North Lounge was an average experience, ok choice of sandwiches but not particularly clean and in need of a refresh. Bused to aircraft, a Boeing 787-9, with premium economy only half full. A half glass of prosecco was offered and a requested top up was forgotten. Fast bar service by excellent cabin crew who offered good customer service. An ok meal with a rancid coleslaw, ok steak and a tiny pot of desert. Generous with the drinks. Unfortunately, the dropping of afternoon tea at the back is inexplicable and really poor judgement by BA. I was offered T&Cs plus a breakfast bar or malt loaf finger. The crew were genuinely embarrassed (a couple of sandwiches I liberated from the club lounge made up for it). Fast off the plane, and despite slow immigration, the bags beat me again. Overall the flight was ok but certainly not up to the standard of premium economy on competitors. The meal is nowhere near Club standard and its the cutting of the small things - nibbles, breakfast and afternoon tea which irk me the most. Be competitive but don't take it out on me! I wouldn't mind but the prices don't go down with the reduction of service. Despite what the CEO maintains - it is not in response to customer feedback. BA need to listen to what we're saying and take a long hard look at their conscious decision to downgrade service and become as bad as the budget airlines. Eventually the hardiest of us loyal BA customers will give up and move airline / alliance and that would be a shame.",Boeing 787-8 / 787-9,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Toronto to London,01/02/2017,no,Verified,10,3,4,2,4,3,1
no better than no frills competitors,Peter Hill,21/02/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Stuttgart. Fly in comfort and style is the slogan of British Airways, but there is not much of either around these days. Not willing to pay an extra £8, I was allocated a middle seat right at the rear. At the gate an announcement was made for volunteers to check in their hand-luggage ""at no extra cost"". Within a minute a burly employee told me I had to check in my cabin bag, saying ""you should not believe what is said on the company's website"". How very true! Some ten other passengers, equally perplexed suffered the same fate. I know there were ten, because another employee kept counting us and saying ""we need ten"". The burly employee was later to be found on the airbridge to make sure that we really did hand over our cabin bags. All in all a demeaning experience. The seat rows are now more tightly packed than before. Although of average slim build, I found the seat a tight fit. Only a few passengers took up the offer to purchase food or drink (the deceptive ""upgrade"" we were sold at the beginning of the year). But still, did not reach the back of the plane until shortly before landing. Not only have the complimentary food and drink disappeared, but also newspapers and priority boarding for those of us who are frequent flyers. On the return journey I noticed part of the reason for this new policy: the Stuttgart ground staff have now been replaced by agency staff. BA is now no better than the no frills competitors, but keeps the facade of a full service airline with full service prices.

on a race to the bottom,Michael Davies,20/02/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Rome return. Race to the bottom. My first time with the new buy onboard service. I was not happy when they announced this and this flight confirmed my disappointment. Basically it does not work. I can understand in some ways why they decided to offer a wide range of food options. I would have accepted this if they had kept the free drinks. Even soft drinks are chargeable - I don't think this is acceptable. However, despite the extensive menu, there was an extremely limited selection available. One crew member came round soon after the flight took off and took orders for hot food. There was a 20-25 minute wait time for this. The crew then came around with the drinks trolley. This was extremely slow. The payments could only be made with credit cards or Avios points. The payment added significant times to process. Despite sitting 3 rows from the front of the cabin, we didn't get our drinks until 30 minutes after they started. There was only the one trolley, and they were still serving the rear of the cabin as we were starting our decent. CEO Alex Cruz and British Airways - your airline used to distinguish itself from the competition but you are on a race to the bottom - more rows in economy, 10 abreast in some 777's and other cost cutting measures mean that even though I'm a Silver Exec club member I am now considering my future travel options.

treats customers with such contempt,A Galyan,20/02/2017,United Kingdom,"  Edinburgh to London City. Despite having a confirmed booking, when I attempted to check-in with a prepaid-for bag at 1535 at the EDI airport for a 1655 flight to LCY (domestic flight) I was told I couldn’t as the flight had been oversold. I accepted an offer to switch to a later flight on the same route with Flybe and take compensation but then was told the compensation couldn’t be authorised so I had to ‘wait’. I then stood around for 10 minutes, being asked to ‘move out of the way’ at one point because I was blocking others. I was not given a copy of the compensation scheme details (despite what the BA website claims should be done) and the staff seemed unclear of it themselves. I was simply ignored until I approached the desk again and insisted to speak to a supervisor. None was available nor could be contacted, apparently. I wasn’t allowed to transfer to the Flybe flight “in case” a seat became available on my original flight, so they tagged my luggage but did not check it in. I was told to wait for another 20 minutes. I argued this was not fair to leave me in limbo given I had a confirmed booking in the first place but I was basically ignored and informed this flight is regularly oversold and it’s not their problem that other people had checked-in before me. I was treated as a nuisance. At one point, there were 5 members of BA check in staff doing nothing (nobody else to serve) whilst I was just standing silently there ‘waiting’ and being ignored. After 20 minutes of not knowing what to do, my original flight closed and I was approached by a supervisor (who suddenly was available to talk to me) and given a seat. I asked how it was that a seat has magically appeared if earlier I had been told the flight was already full with no seats available. He explained that the seats had been prepaid for by others who had then not checked in, and as the check-in was closing, they could give me the seat now. I informed him that I resented having been treated rudely by his staff earlier (though the supervisor himself was professional and courteous) and that his staff are untrained to deal with overbookings. I had done nothing wrong to deserve being treated so shabbily, like a problem rather than a customer. I then had a predictably stressful rush through security to ensure I was not denied boarding at the gate for being late (even though I had arrived at the airport with plenty of time to spare originally, especially for a domestic flight). As I told the supervisor, if the airline treats its customers with such contempt, do not be surprised that the public ends up viewing the airline with contempt. Under their current policy of overbooking, passengers who do not pay more to reserve a seat in advance are at risk of not getting a seat at all, even though they have a confirmed booking. Some would call this cheating. The saving grace of the experience was that the flight was punctual, and unlike mainline BA, this route is run by its subsidiary BA CityFlyer which still offers complimentary drinks and a snack for which the cabin crew service was efficient. I rate it 2 out of 10 for the stress incurred in checking in.",Embraer 170,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Edinburgh to London City,01/02/2017,no,Verified,5,3,3,3,1,4,-1

Short-sighted management or what?,M Kemp,18/02/2017,United Kingdom,"  This a tale of two airlines and their individual approaches to Business Class passengers. We were flying to Mauritius on holiday and I felt, given the flying time, we should spoil ourselves and fly up-front with all the 'comparative' comfort of Business Class. The British Airways flight itself was okay, the crew friendly and the cabin worked fine. However, I was totally shocked by the standards of catering in the Gatwick Lounge (a small issue for some perhaps, but for me, it's all part of the Business Class experience). To illustrate my point, I attach a shot of what Walsh's policy of putting shareholders first actually means for fare-paying passengers. With the very confusing layout that greets one in the South Terminal now that BA have moved in, the 'serve yourself' check-in (you even label your own bags!). I was pretty frustrated by the time we actually found the 'Lounge'. But then to be greeted with this, was totally unacceptable. So, Willie, rather than screwing down costs for the benefit of your shareholders, this sort of display of overt cost-cutting has now lost you revenue for the future. Short-sighted management or what? Take a lesson from Emirates who I decided to fly home with, so disgusted was I over our experience.

The cabin is looking rather tired and worn and the seats are not comfortable enough for a 9 hour flight. I was very pleased to have booked an exit row seat for additional room. The IFE system is also quite dated and limited compared to modern offerings. On the plus side the cabin staff were friendly, helpful and courteous and this is somewhere BA seem to do well. Food and drink were complimentary and of decent quality for economy class. Boarding at YVR was very well organised, less so at the Heathrow end. It is also a shame that these flights depart from the cramped Terminal 3 at Heathrow.

Flight barely a quarter full,2 reviews,17/02/2017,United Kingdom,"  Return trip from Washington Dulles to London Heathrow. Flight was barely a quarter full. Going to Washington flight was probably only about a third full. Attendants said it was the quietest they had every seen. Given that I was on an A380 it really did look empty. Food and service was good both ways and the aircraft was only a couple of years old. Plenty of room on the downstairs cabin and the overhead lockers seemed larger than any other airliner I'd flown on. I was given an exit row seat which was very welcome. BA usually charge £58 for this seat. It meant about 5 foot of legroom and because the next cabin in front was business class the toilets were curtained off for the entire flight meaning the area was very quiet. No real gripes although the ""snack"" served about an hour before landing has been downgraded from a small meal to a tiny Twix chocolate and a cup of coffee. Flight cost £430 and using some airmiles I knocked this down to £330.

I did that a month ago, at the same time as I made my booking, and paid for an aisle seat of my choice. When I went back one week before my journey, my aisle seat was gone and I was placed in an undesirable middle seat. There was no remedy for this. Five calls over three days to BA connected me to people in Delhi whose only vocabulary was unfortunately, sorry, and just no. I have been deceived, lied to, and put off. I have flown British many times; this is absolutely my last time. It is acceptable to make an error, but totally unacceptable to callously make no effort at all to rectify it.

quality of British Airways has most certainly gone downhill,A Chinnery,15/02/2017,United Kingdom,"  The quality of British Airways has most certainly gone downhill. On short haul from London Heathrow to Rome it is nothing more than that of easyjet. Online check in was quick and easy, and terminal 5 is a delight however online check in is only available 24 hours before departure unlike easyjet which allows for check in 30 days prior to departure. That was the only good part of our journey. We boarded a packed old 767 which was decaying with the middle seat (E) so narrow it was impossible to get in and out of the seat in flight. (We were in row 13). Without notice, we had to go through de-icing which meant a 45min delay to our service (we did however catch up 35mins). Our inbound flight was on a newer A319 which had better seats and a skymap. Due to slot restrictions at Rome and London, this flight was also delayed. During both flights the new buy on board was poorly done, taking forever with a limited range of overpriced products. I therefore can only conclude that the airline that once one just 10 months ago offering meals on short haul flights as well as always being on time is now nothing more than a low cost carrier with older planes and a useless service.

Immediately on reaching cruising altitude, we were informed that they were now serving ""lunch"". At 10am. We were told that we would be given sandwiches on descent, this on a 7 hour flight. A cynical person might think that the crew wanted to get meal service out of the way early. I don't know what timezone ""lunch"" was in, possibly Bangkok, but certainly not Doha or London time. After 5 hours I rang the bell. The female cabin crew person came and asked incredulously, ""did you ring the bell""? Yes, once, the entire flight. I asked for the sandwich and she told me that I would have to wait. No, I want it now. Not a five course meal, a sandwich. Having just flown on Qatar Airways where the entire menu is a la carte and you can order anything at any time, apparently a pre-prepared sandwich was a big ask. In business class.

If the food is ""M&S"" concept, why don't they get M&S to supply them the wines too? Years ago the selection process at British Airways was different and the wines were then great! But overall my flight to Gatwick was enjoyable, the crew professional, and hardly more expensive than EasyJet on the same route. My next BA trip is on February 18th, this time to Shanghai. I am concerned, though, to read the generally appalling comments about BA's long haul routes by various travellers and worry about what to expect now on my forthcoming flight, in economy! I hope BA is taking these comments onboard seriously.",A320,Business,Economy Class,Bordeaux to London Gatwick,01/01/2017,yes,Not Verified,8,2,3,2,5,5,-1
"attentive, friendly cabin crew",Hamilton Lowe,04/02/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to San Francisco return. Upgraded from Premium economy to Business on outward leg and Business as booked on return. Both legs on the A380 which is a super plane, spacious, comfortable and clean. Entertainment screens are so much bigger than those on the older 747's. Both flights were very good with attentive, friendly cabin crew and excellent food. My only complaint was that the inbound flight was 7 minutes past scheduled time and this was sufficient for me to miss my connecting flight. BA should never book connections with such a tight schedule. Problem was compounded by disinterested ground staff, especially a BA manager at T5 who was more interested in continuing a conversation with colleagues than assisting a passenger who was helping to pay his wages.",A380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,LHR to SFO,01/01/2017,yes,Not Verified,8,5,5,5,1,4,4
brand suicide at its worst,D Webb,04/02/2017,Denmark,"  London Heathrow to Copenhagen. My first time experiencing British Airways buy-on-board service. This must be brand suicide at its worst. How BA can go from a full-service carrier to low cost overnight is astounding. The brand is now cheapened, the offering before wasn't gourmet, but at least you could pass the time with a tea and biscuit, now you can't even get hot water for free. Even SAS offer a complimentary coffee. What ceases to amaze me is more and more is taken away by British Airways in every single class you travel, yet you don't see a decrease in ticket prices. The positives to this flight were that it was on time and the crew were friendly , but I do feel it must be a complete embarrassment for them.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Copenhagen,01/02/2017,no,Verified,7,3,4,-1,4,3,-1

Cons: limited legroom in economy (additionally limited by the electronix box beneath the seat). Overall I am impressed. Decent value for the money paid.

fallen behind other airlines,Mike Bailey,03/02/2017,United Kingdom,"  Heathrow to Hong Kong in Business Class on 3rd January as part of a holiday to New Zealand, also involving flights with Cathay Pacific and Malaysia Airlines. The flight to Hong Kong with British Airways showed up all that is bad about British Airways now and how far it has fallen behind other airlines. The continual penny pinching and poor staff attitude was evident throughout the flight. Check-in at Terminal 5 was chaotic, there having been a ""computer glitch"" which greatly slowed the check-in and bag drop processes. There were too few BA staff on hand to assist and those that were in evidence were being continually harassed. Business check-in was better but still very busy. BA needs to speed up bag drop urgently. Other airports allow you to print your own baggage labels and take your baggage straight to be loaded onto the conveyor belt where a member of staff checks the weight to make sure it is not too heavy, not perfect for all passengers but would considerably speed up the process for the vast majority of passengers who can check in easily. The lounge was a disappointment with tired dirty furniture, used dishes not being cleared, too few seats for the number of passengers and very poor food availability. Not a great place to rest before an 11 hour journey and I would concur with other comments about the deteriorating standards. Compare this to the other ""home"" lounges of other carriers such as those at Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur. Took a shower whilst waiting and that was OK. The flight was not good at all. Cabin crew showed general lack of interest throughout the flight and seemed interested in just getting the meals served and then disappearing from view for the rest of the flight until it was time for the meal service prior to landing. Gone are all the small (and not so small) touches that made flying with BA a pleasure, such as hanging up coats, hot towels, a second round of drinks, a nice meal at a leisurely pace and an overall feeling of being well looked after. A comment about the seats, how can BA justify 8 across in Business Class? When the ying/yang seats were first introduced they were a revolution, but a lot of other airlines now only have 6 across with a lot more space and comfort and in most cases you don't have to climb over another person to get out whilst they are sleeping. I had a window seat and I felt very hemmed in. There was no storage space for the things you need during a flight, glasses, tablet computer, water bottle etc. All were kept on the floor or crammed down the side of the seat. Sadly BA is no longer my airline of choice. I spent many years doing international business travel and when you saw the Union Flag on the tailfin at some distant airport you knew you were already nearly home. I saved a considerable number of Avios points for my retirement which I am now using up, but on other airlines within the One World Alliance where possible and who offer a far better product and actually look after their passengers and make them feel wanted. Sorry BA but you've lost my loyalty. Club World is now very poor (and also Club Europe now) and you've lost the plot to the bean counters.

friendly and efficient service,M Lester,01/02/2017,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Mauritius return. Absolutely fine from online check in, baggage drop at Gatwick to collecting baggage in Mauritius. Allocated seats together (2 passengers) given at online check in, with no need to change these. Pleasant and courteous staff member at baggage drop. Boarding by cabin class and row numbers and ran pretty smoothly. Boeing 777 about 16 years old, but still in presentable condition. I'm 1.8 m. tall and medium build and I found the seat pretty comfortable for a 12-hour flight in economy - at least this aircraft type is still 9 abreast despite the slightly dated look of the cabin. Not the largest seat screen I've experienced but fine, and there was a reasonable selection of movies, tv and music. Drinks service followed by hot meal (roast chicken in sauce or veggie option). We ate in the terminal before departing just in case the food offering was going to be dire, but despite the reduction in food given on the tray we couldn't really fault what was provided. Lights out after dinner until about an hour before landing when a hot breakfast was served. Cabin crew friendly and efficient service, with water service through the night, plus option to get drinks from the galley. Landed on time. Spent ages in the queue at immigration, luggage waiting for us and then taxi to hotel. We got there safely, on time and in reasonable comfort.

dreadful business class experience,S Mullins,31/01/2017,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Barcelona return, and just dreadful pretty much sums up this British Airways business class experience. Since BA moved to Gatwick south terminal, their new lounge is still not ready. They're currently using the clubrooms and the old Virgin Atlantic lounge, now called the speedbird lounge. Gold card holders and passengers travelling in business or first class use the clubrooms. What a sorry state this lounge was. Full, with limited seating, a forty minute wait for food, no available snacks and empty drinks cabinets. I left as hungry and thirsty as I arrived. No to worry though, British Airways will feed me onboard. Once onboard, for a two hour flight, I was served afternoon tea which consisted of three finger sandwiches, a scone and a really small slice of cake. This meal was completely insufficient. There was one drinks round offered and one top up offered. Given that BA use the smallest glasses possible, coupled with its love of miniature cans of lemonade, you will be thirsty. I found trading up to business class to be completely not worth the extra spend. After being disappointed by the outbound catering my disappointment was set to continue with the exact same afternoon tea meal served on my inbound flight.

Comfortable flights and first-rate cabin service both ways. A late departure from BCN on the return trip due to fog in London was largely made up for and I made my connection to Washington with time to spare. Also, my checked bag did not make it on the original flight to Barcelona but a claim was put in for and my bag was delivered to my hotel the following morning. Concerning the M&S food and drink service on European sectors, I don't normally eat on short-hauls, but I did note that one of the drinks on offer in this service is my favourite ale, Old Speckled Hen, not previously seen by me on an airline (I paid with Avios). I don't enjoy having to pay for something that was once available for free, but sometimes there are compensations.

Seats the same as anyone else and they insist on putting these silly yellow cabin bag bands on carry on bags like they mean anything. I checked a bag so just had a small carry on but the staff insisted it have this silly thing attached that I immediately ripped off.

how the mighty have fallen,P Eden,29/01/2017,United Kingdom,"  How the mighty have fallen, or should I say continue to fall. My partner and I booked tickets from London to Johannesburg back in September 16, we paid approx £1700 for the 2 economy tickets (slightly more than normal as we paid for extra leg room seats). It was an evening flight and we were traveling on the relatively new A380, our first problem was that our there was not enough room for our hand luggage near to our seats, so it was placed some 30 feet further down the aircraft - not life threatening, just annoying when you want to get things out of the bag, we were surprised about the lack of space. Our real issue was that when it came to serving our evening meal that the flight attendant announced ""here is your vegetable lasagne"" rather than explaining that for our £1700 they were not able to offer us the default evening meal (chicken or beef) as they had ran out of these! They made no effort to remedy the situation, whether there were other choices in premium or business we will never know, all I can say is that I am pretty easy to please when it comes to food but wasn't happy with a vegetable lasagne so I had no meal as a result. As I left the aircraft I received a text from BA asking for feedback on the flight, I took the time to respond  explaining all the above but received no response. Whilst I was in Johannesburg I tried to contact/ call Johannesburg to complain but trying to contact and speak to anyone at BA is like trying to get an audience with Pope Francis! I eventually received an email response stating that my complaint didn't qualify for any redress, I then challenged this, I explained that in a hypothetical situation whereas the passenger paid for their fare as they left the aircraft 1) would I have been prepared to pay the full cost of the flight (no!) and 2) would BA if they were reasonable, expect me to pay the full cost. In summary, I eventually was offered £15 credit off my next BA flight - totally unacceptable as I don't fly that often, even £15 shopping vouchers and an apology would have been sufficient, I felt hugely disappointed with our national carrier and it's onboard service and the same for it's customer relations which arrogantly doesn't give a damn.

Boarding was quick and friendly welcome from cabin crew. Seats are cramped and on a par with low cost standards, cabin was reasonably clean. Flight crew gave good information. Inflight the crew started the new food and drink sales, and this was where the chaos started. The time they were taking for each row they served was excruciating. I was seated 9 rows back and gave up waiting for a drink and dozed off. Before landing I spoke to my neighbour and asked if they finally got served ... they said the sandwiches had all run out long before staff got them. This was not a cheap fare that I got, and British Airways state publicly that their customers asked for this new service, buy onboard etc. What a lie, I have yet to meet anyone who has been asked what they wanted in the many months before BA stopped any complimentary service.

they have lost absolutely their unique selling points,Gerald Pitcher,26/01/2017,United Kingdom,"  The decline of British Airways. My review is primarily on BA Euro Traveller in economy. Up to two years ago one felt good when travelling BA. They were miles ahead of budget airlines. Yes they were a bit more expensive, but one enjoyed reasonable food and beverage, checked in cases of 20kg, all part of the service. Today BA provides no free food or beverage, and require extra payment for check in luggage. Today, within Europe, BA has absolutely no advantage opposite EasyJet, Norwegian, Monarch or even Ryanair. Why should anyone pay extra for BA, they have lost absolutely their unique selling points. Incidentally coming back from Malta to London Gatwick in BA in business class, there is nowhere to hang coats. Previously BA flight attendants always hung them in a cupboard. And now NO CUPBOARDS!

treating premium passengers with contempt,4 reviews,26/01/2017,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. Having previously flown BA First Class on the Boeing 777 and A380, this trip on an ageing Boeing 747-400 from Heathrow Terminal 3 was disappointing. The sooner BA replace these aircraft, the better. I had a window seat which at least was not as cramped as the middle seats, which looked more like BA's dreadful Club World seats. The first disappointment came after pre-booking meals only to be told that due to the cabin crew strike which had ended the day before we were flying, we would get a Club World meal instead. Why? There are only 14 First Class seats and the caterers were not on strike so quite annoyed to be offered a few AVIOS as compensation! The IFE screen quality was poor and the movie selection not particularly good. The good thing was that we had 2 excellent ladies serving in our cabin. BA need to stop treating their premium passengers with contempt and wake up to the fact there is a lot of competition. Priority boarding is a joke; anybody with a Bronze Executive club card gets that so half the aircraft rush to the boarding gate. Priorities need re-assessing (and controlling). Special needs and First Class passengers first and then trickle down from there.

as different as night and day,8 reviews,25/01/2017,United Kingdom,"  San Francisco to Johannesburg via London. The two flights were as different as night and day. Both night flights so the idea was to get as much sleep as possible. SFO-LHR BA286 19th January was a full Business Class cabin but amazing service by mature flight attendants. Perfect mix of professionalism, friendliness and efficiency although the Boeing 747 had seen better days. They had the main meal service done and dusted within two hours allowing for plenty of sleep. LHR-JNB, BA055 on 20th January was an absolute disgrace. Great aircraft but let down by shambolic and rude in flight service. These attendants were much younger and besides looking sullen and miserable the main meal service took 4 hours - this on a night flight. Post take off drinks were served relatively quickly. There was then a massive gap between that and the meal order being taken. And a further huge gap between the meal service being started. All the while being delivered by the most miserable steward I've ever had the displeasure to encounter. Being a Gold card holder the CSM (who was a delight) came to give me her 'personal welcome' and I did feedback about my experience. She acknowledged that these new crews are 'inexperienced' and I said that's no excuse for rudeness. Why can BA not mix the old and new crew together if the newbies cannot get to grips with a basic efficient service? Later had the pleasure of flying JNB-CPT on Comair (a BA franchise in South Africa). What a great little airline. Again very young crew but an absolute delight. Overall I give the journey a 6/10 but my breakdown would be SFO-LHR 9/10, LHR-JNB 2/10, JNB-CPT 9/10.

The business class lounge facilities were not available due to move to south terminal. We had to use the general lounge that any passenger prepared to pay £37.50 could use. This meant it was overcrowded and dirty (through no fault of the regular staff. They just could not keep up with the number of passengers). We could not get a seat anywhere and when we advised BA staff of this we were told to come back later and see if there were any seats free. The BA ground staff were completely overwhelmed by the number of business class passengers complaining and appeared at their wits end. The flight was mediocre to say the least. The food was average and the service satisfactory. Having paid £2000 for a ticket it is not unreasonable to expect a good service. We formally complained to British Airways via their customer services department and the response came back as they were moving to the south terminal and we needed to be understanding as things would get better in the future! We were not even offered a refund on the tea we bought in the main area of the terminal as we could not get into the lounge they had provided.

No. This is why: On the flight there were two members of cabin crew in the First cabin, with 8 passengers. The 1st cabin crew member was polite and professional. The 2nd cabin crew member was extremely unprofessional. The supplied headphone set was faulty and did not work. I had to ask twice for a replacement set. It took over 40 minutes to receive this. Once airborne, I ordered a cappuccino. I had to ask three times for this and wait over 50 minutes for it to arrive. There were multiple issues with my dinner: - I was the second person to order my dinner; yet the last person to be served. It took over 2 hours to get my dinner. Someone who had ordered after me, got my dinner option (I was told some 30 minutes after placing my order that only one option was available). It would appear that this passenger had a higher Executive Club membership and therefore was given my choice of main course. I was only given the option of a Club World main course (which was delayed further as I was initially given the wrong order). This delay in service had a detriment to my own sleeping plans and I was extremely disappointed at the service from the 2nd cabin crew member. There were issues with my breakfast: Despite being the first passenger to wake up and order my breakfast, another passenger was served first and given my breakfast. I ordered a Cappuccino; the 2nd cabin crew member ignored this order. When I enquired again (some 40 minutes after I had placed my order) I was told that the seat belt sign was now on and therefore I could not have this. I was extremely disappointed as at the material time I placed my order (and for some time after this) there had been no seat belt sign displayed. The First cabin toilet was not cleaned properly throughout the flight. Formal Complaint Within 24 hours of landing in KUL, I wrote a formal letter of complaint outlining the aforementioned issues and emailed this to the CEO of British Airways, Alex Cruz. The ‘You First’ department at British Airways confirmed receipt of my email. Subsequently, I received a very generic response from British Airways Customer Relations. No attempt was made to address (or even explore) the issues that gave rise to my complaint. This was disappointing. I was simply offered 10,000 Avios points. I responded by return, rejecting this offer and again asked for an explanation to why I had received such poor service during my flight and why no attempt had been made by British Airways to address the issues that I had outlined in my formal complaint. The response from British Airways Customer Relations was again disappointing and did not offer any explanation other than the matter would be dealt with internally and that the gesture of 10,000 Avios points was because British Airways “have to be consistent so we’re fair to all our customers”. I found this statement somewhat ironic.",Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,First Class,LHR to KUL,01/11/2016,no,Verified,1,3,1,1,3,1,3
reduced to that of a budget airline,Alan Whitlock,18/01/2017,United Kingdom,"  St Petersburgh to London. I don’t know where BA got this market research to say stop complementary meals, we prefer to pay for it ! I’ve yet to find anyone who agrees with this idea and certainly no one asked me for my opinion. If you want to buy something different, you always have the option in the endless airport shops before boarding. I suggest they look seriously at their market research company if this is true, though I suspect the real reason is cost cutting, BA just doesn’t want to admit it. BA would be better off to admit it, customers would have more sympathy than trying to promote this policy as some benefit to the customer when clearly they are removing benefit and keeping price the same, we can all see through the attempted deception and it does the image no good. To tell me that charging £1.80 for water or soft drink is a bargain when I can buy the same thing in Tesco for 63p insults my intelligence, they are exploiting the fact that passengers cannot carry liquids through security so they have a captive market, again a great image to promote to the world. Where possible myself and family will now actively seek to avoid being a BA passenger where any alternative exists.

plane had not been cleaned well,M Cooper,17/01/2017,United Kingdom,"  We travelled Business Class from Gatwick to Barbados return for Christmas 2016. The outbound flight plane had not been cleaned well at all - food crumbs around seat area, stained carpets, wet toilet floors etc. The cabin crew member was not aware of taking passenger coat procedure and suggested we ""hang it up wherever you can find space"" - we collected our own coats prior to landing. When the food was served we had been noted as 'not eating' - when the mistake was realised and the mistake initially made by the senior stewardess, the two hot options were unavailable - I had cheese and biscuits and my husband went without. The quality of the video/audio was very poor - the picture clarity poor and the sound distorted making certain films unwatchable. On the return flight the Executive Lounge was fully booked and we had to use the packed lounge in the main terminal. During the inbound flight the young cabin steward was constantly chewing gum - not a very professional image! On our return the only response by BA to our complaints was additional Avios Points - an unacceptable response a fair and reasonable complaint and an offer that we are unlikely to take advantage of.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,LGW to BGI,01/12/2016,no,Verified,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
no appeal whatsoever anymore,B Saunders,16/01/2017,United Kingdom," We had the ""pleasure"" of flying back to the UK on the first day of BA's fantastic idea of starting to charge for drinks and snacks (a la sister company Iberia). Someone please explain to me what the difference is with Ryanair, Easyjet and Norwegian now? It's become a budget airline and I for one won't be using them anymore if I can avoid it. They cut the Avios for flights, made it more difficult to go up tiers and now this joke? I'm not even bothered about the sandwich to be really honest but on a 4 hour flight I expect BA to give me a drink. Then when I wanted to buy a sandwich I was told that there were only 3 for the entire plane and they sold out. Salad then? Sold out. Some crisps? Unfortunately the person in front of me got the last bag. BA you aren't Iberia or Air Lingus. Stop this nonsense please. Take an example to KLM. The week before, AMS - MAD, hot pasta, 2 rounds of drinks and then cake with coffee or tea and that was Economy also.

arrivals lounge at LHR was great,1 reviews,15/01/2017,United Kingdom,  Houston to London Heathrow in Business Class. The service from the cabin crew was less attentive and organised than the outbound flight. British Airways used a Boeing 777 plane rather than the 747 used on the outward journey. This meant there was no upper deck seating. The seats are comfortable and convert to flat beds. Both journeys provided a welcome drink and 3 course menu. I found I was still hungry after the meal so made use of the snacks available at the bar.

business class in need of major refurbishment,S Sidwell,14/01/2017,United Kingdom," Flew London Gatwick to Cancun in business class on a B777 that looked in need of a major refurbishment. The cabin was drab and dated; the entertainment screen was small and the choice limited; the food was, for business class, not particularly good quality and poorly presented - in particular the second meal (on an 11 hour flight) was a packet of sandwiches and some cake. I am quite capable of opening my own packet of sandwiches but given the price of flying business class I'd have thought BA could make some effort to present the food better.

profit at any price,Rosemary Hill,13/01/2017,Switzerland,"  London to Hong Kong return. Through no fault of our own, very late-running bus, major road accident, and a driver who threw us off in the cargo area and told us to wait for the next bus – my friend and I missed our 18.30 flight to Hong Kong on December 12th. We thought we would be re-booked on the later 20.50 flight, especially since we had business class tickets. Instead, we were told by the BA official at the misnamed ‘Customer Services’ desk that we had ‘voluntarily’ missed our plane (I assume that was code for ‘it’s your fault, not our problem’; that was certainly what his attitude conveyed). We were then offered 3 options – pay a supplement of £1478 to take the 20.50 flight, take a downgrade to Premium Economy WITHOUT a guarantee that BA would reimburse us the difference in seat price, or wait four days. The BA official couldn’t have been less flexible or sympathetic, and BA has responded to my complaint via Twitter with the same disinterest. My travel companion’s business class seat was a gift for her 60th birthday. Any pleasure she might have got from it, and mine in giving it to her, were ruined by the way we were treated. On the (half-empty) flight back on New Year’s Eve the crew obviously didn’t want to be there, was barely courteous, and when my friend, a diabetic, enquired what would be in her special meal, she was told no-one knew. They clearly didn’t care, either. They did very grudgingly eventually agree that she could order from the regular menu after making it clear that this was an exception and a ‘privilege’ she was being granted. I would have thought, and expected, a little more courtesy and grace, especially in Business Class. God knows how the poor souls in the back were treated. I have given my preference to BA for years in order to support my home airline. Sadly, I don’t think they deserve my custom any longer, so the next time we fly to Asia we will take one of the Gulf airlines who at least give the impression that they want and value your custom. BA’s only concern these days is profit at any price; their customer service is as poor as any I’ve ever come across, and their corporate motto ‘To Fly To Serve’ an embarrassing joke. I’ve flown with them several times a year for the last 35 years, but I won’t be doing it again unless it can’t possibly be avoided.

have once again been disappointed by British Airways,P Brown,05/01/2017,United Kingdom,"  Miami to London Business Class. Living in London, and flying international long haul flights throughout the year I have once again been disappointed by British Airways poor maintenance for premium amenities in preferred cabins. Our family of four were travelling home from the Christmas holidays on an overnight flight and when I was ready to sleep I attempted to recline my seat in the ""flat bed position"". My seat would not recline. The flight was completely full and there were no other seats available to switch me to. These are simple checks a maintenance crew could and should go through prior to boarding an aircraft. I notified the flight attendant to see if he had any knowledge as to how the seat could be adjusted in an attempt to fix it. Sadly, he did not. I was informed that the head/purser was on his crew rest and that he would come discuss the situation with me in an hour and a half. Hopefully his accommodations were better than mine. Prior to landing (20 minutes before on a 9 hour flight), the purser spoke to me and apologised on behalf of BA and said he could compensate me with either £50 or 10,000 Avios. I informed him there was a far greater price point between Premium Economy vs. Business Class. Understandably, he apologised and said that was all he was capable of doing. I received a call from a BA representative and I was informed that she could only provide me with similar compensation - £50 or 10,000 Avios. (I currently have 588,500 avois on BA that is nearly impossible to use). I requested an upgrade on an upcoming flight from Heathrow to Atlanta from a Premium Economy seat to a Business Class seat. The BA representative said that she could not do this as customers pay for the Business Class experience - the food, individual flight attendant service and comfort. Sleeping is the entire point of purchasing a Business Class seat - not the food. My comfort was not met.

Cabin staff stomp up and down the aisle attending to premium economy - bumped into numerous times. Toilet locations on board are terrible - those poor people seated right next to the WC door.

The seats on BA are narrow, lack privacy (the face of a stranger next to me facing in the opposite direction was about 2 feet, 60 cm, from me) and don't even dream about any storage space (I couldn't find a flat surface to place my eyeglasses on, and I kept my water bottle on the floor under the seat). The footrest had to be operated manually. The entire experience was so irritating that I didn't know whether I should complain or just laugh at it. I have no idea how BA can get away with this.

cabin crew excelled throughout ,Mike Palmer,02/01/2017,Canada,"  Toronto to London return in Club World on 787-900 with British Airways. Outbound was upgraded a couple of months ago from World Traveller Plus (worth the money for a decent night's sleep). Fast check in and fast track security at Pearson meant I was in the lounge within 15 mins. Excellent lounge supper service with a choice of a roast or noodles in soup. The lounge is well managed and maintained with friendly staff and a well stocked bar. On time boarding but a delayed departure due to loading baggage. A glass of champagne, with a top up, before departure. I always find boarding in Club World disjointed and fragmented as crew from World Traveler assist making the pre departure service erratic. A fast drinks service and supper were served with lights out. A well timed late breakfast meant a decent 5 hours sleep on this leg and my food choices were actually available. Priority bags beat me to the baggage belt. The return leg was enhanced due to being upgraded 24 hours before departure. (clearly oversold for such early action but welcome as a BA Silver member). The flight was one of my best business class flights and reminded me of the old BA I knew and loved. Fast bar service done by tray and not by cart, an excellent meal of roast chicken, with a delicious caramel desert (plated too) and some decent wines. The only reduction in service spotted this time was the wine list was down to two reds, two whites and no Rose. That said, the wines were very good. The cabin crew excelled throughout with the two crew professional, friendly and delivering excellent customer service promptly when asked. Afternoon tea is a now a bit of let down with the scones dropped. An early landing, and prompt bags on the belt completed a stellar trip back home. If only BA could deliver this standard consistently with an improved product and friendly crew and sort out the flawed and outdated seat layout, then there is a chance BA could return to it's former glory",Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Business Class,YYZ to LHR,01/12/2016,yes,Verified,3,3,5,4,4,4,4

offered excellent attentive service,3 reviews,27/12/2016,United Kingdom,"  Having read so many negative reviews on this site regarding British Airways and their First Class product I was somewhat concerned as to what the experience would be like on our First Class flight from LHR-SAN on BA273 on their B747-400, I needn't have worried, this flight was excellent on all aspects. Our domestic connecting flight from MAN-LHR was delayed by 2 hours due to fog at LHR, the Captain  came into the Gate area and explained the reasons of the delay and invited questions from any concerned passengers about their connecting flights in LHR. Luckily we had planned 4 hours into our itinerary so the delay caused us no problems, passengers with tight connections at LHR were offered alternative connection options. The Concorde Lounge in LHR T5 BA First Class passengers was superb with professional and courteous staff, we had booked a Cabana and Spa Treatments, both were superb and highly recommended, plan time into your itinerary to enjoy these to the full. The lounge offers A la Carte Dining and the food was excellentpromptly, Champagne and great wines were also available. Onboard the BA747 in the First Cabin we had seats 2A & 2K, these offered great comfort for the 11 hour flight, the seats were made into a bed by the cabin crew when you requested it, I got 6 hours sleep, good quality quilts and pillows helped this. Seats 1A or 1K may have been slightly better for a couple travelling together as they are closer together than 2A 2K, but this is not a negative issue. The meal service was excellent, dine when you want, excellent choice of aperitifs, wines and champagne. The young Cabin Crew offered excellent attentive service in a very professional manner throughout the 11 hour flight. First Class seats offer good privacy, probably centre seats 4EF and 5EF offer the least privacy and therefore I would avoid these where possible.

This caused us to miss our connecting flight to Venice, thereby incurring a 7 hour wait at Heathrow. Overall a loss of a half day. Thinking that BA would want to atone for royally jobbing us on the flights, was wasted. A couple of low cost vouchers for small meals were provided. A suggestion that access to the British Airways lounge would be a class way to assuage the delay was met with a look of astonishment.

Seats are so narrow - I paid extra for the emergency seat ($85!) after reading how narrow the seats were, a wise decision, but I shouldn't be paying extra as all middle-east and Asian airlines I have flown have bigger seats, better food choice, better entertainment - how can they offer such a poor service?",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to EZE,01/12/2016,no,Verified,8,1,2,2,2,2,1
food was miserable,Natalie Tan,13/12/2016,Singapore," Hong Kong to London. First time doing long haul on British Airways. Arm rest does not fully go up and I had an empty seat next to me. Food was miserable - especially the dinner. A giant chicken chunk with some vegetables and potatos. Leg room was terrible and minimal for an aisle seat and cramped. Inflight entertainment was a bore - too little adult music like rock / country / jazz. Some staff were very polite and pleasant while 2 or 3 were grumpy and seemed to not want to be working and dragging their feet. CSL was fab and another male attendant working the first cabin of world traveler on the main deck when I could not sleep and went to the galley to chat. Lack of snack choices which was poor, how many lemon cookies can you eat?

We paid for the premium economy upgrade and the Flight Attendant would not allow us to recline the seat back because the people behind us were complaining.

not up to par with competitors,S Ratham,11/12/2016,United States,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Mumbai via London Heathrow after a reroute due to Lufthansa strike. Overall British Airways business class product is not up to par with competitors and feels like a premium economy experience. Ground staff at DFW were OK though there was no agent in the lounge till about 3 hours before departure. On board the seat if flat, but very narrow. Food was awful and felt like an economy class meal served on china; no flair and was unimaginative at best. Crew on both flights were fairly mediocre - just went through the motions but didn't seem particularly interested in passenger service at all.The second meal on LHR-BOM was the worst meal I have had on an airplane - literally a deep fried potato and thats it. Lounge at LHR was unimpressive and overly crowded with minimal food selection- sad display for their main hub. Overall I would not fly on BA by choice given their mediocre product.

profoundly uncomfortable when fully flat,G Dawson,11/12/2016,United States,"  Flew from LHR to AUS. British Airways Club World seats are barely wider than coach, and the curvature of the shell makes it feel tighter in the shoulders than coach until the seat is almost half reclined. Profoundly uncomfortable when fully flat as there is a hard bulge at the hinge, best sleeping position is with head elevated a few inches. Could barely wedge myself into the window seat despite unrestricted aisle access, couldn't get out of the seat without putting my hand on and pulling down the seat divider. Footstool that makes up lower part of flat bed came unhooked and dropped to the floor four times on preceding flight. Plane is new with great windows. Restrooms a bit cramped compared to Airbus 330.

Quite enjoyable flights both ways with first-rate leg-room (38in in WTP vs 31in in regular WT remains a strong positive point with me), some of the best airline cuisine I've had in recent years, an excellent pre-meal drinks service including Tribute Cornish ale, on-time departure/arrival and the attentive, courteous cabin-crew service I've received through the years from British Airways. (Two tiny flyspecks though - no more newspapers on boarding and no nibbles with the drinks service, but nowhere nearly enough to ruin the overall trip.) This remains my favourite way of flying between the USA and Europe. I am a regular Skytrax reader and note the numerous negative reviews BA's regular tourist-class service has latterly received in this forum (haven't flown it myself in a couple of years though), but on this and other recent showings BA's World Traveller Plus premium economy remains as good as ever.",A380 and Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,IAD to LHR,01/12/2016,yes,Verified,10,5,5,5,5,5,-1
poor facilities BA now provide,Simon Channon,09/12/2016,United Kingdom,"  Flew Club World from Chengdu to London last week, my first time on BA long haul for a few years. How they manage to retain their reputation is a complete mystery, with the onboard product being simply awful - and this on a newer Boeing 787 plane! The cabin was tatty - tables loose, problems with seat recline mechanism, IFE clunky and slow. The food was not even to economy standards, and the lack of choices in the lunch demonstrates pitiful money saving. Amenity kit second rate, the lavatory did not seem to be checked by crew from start to finish, and whilst the flight was quite empty in business, the service seemed to be on a go-slow. Staff (when they appeared in the cabin) were quite friendly, but they all seemed unhappy and quite ashamed of the poor facilities that BA now provide. I will go back to using my preferred Asian airlines, and I can only assume other BA ""loyals"" will also start switching as the management seem intent on driving BA down to low cost airline levels.",Boeing 787,Business,Business Class,CTU to LHR,01/12/2016,no,Verified,3,2,3,1,2,1,2

meal left a little to be desired,26 reviews,08/12/2016,United States,"  Seattle to London Heathrow. The British Airways Lounge at Seattle is very poor for starters, with old lounge seats which are stained and give the impression it's still the 1990's. Plane was half full as it was Thanksgiving Day so that made for a nice relaxed flight. No real complaints as the seats in business class are private and comfortable for sleeping although the meal quality left a little to be desired. Woke just over an hour before landing and was served a bowl of cereal. No juice, fruit etc. and had to ask for the main dish which the crew seemed reluctant to provide, and when they did was just handed to me, without anything else. Glad this ticket was on miles.

Sydney to Singapore was upgraded to World Traveller plus. Apart from the larger TV Screens, wider seats and legroom, the service and meals were similar to economy. Singapore to London on the A380 was tight and IFE boxes under the seats severely restricts leg room. In economy no amenity packs, no snacks on the 13hr flight and limited drink services. Dinner was served 1.5hr after take off and was pretty gross then breakfast was served 2 hr prior to landing. Other 5 flights meals were just okay. I stocked up with snacks for all the other flights. Drinks are walked around or if you dare go to the galley. Was very disappointed on all 6 flights that the cabin crew were not very friendly or helpful.

a little disappointed,Kathleen Kirby,06/12/2016,United Kingdom," British Airways crew going out from London Heathrow to Calgary were very keen and enthusiastic. They were also very good fun, which makes life more pleasant up in the sky. We do this flight every 6 months on our way to visit family in Canada. Food was good, but like other reviewers we've noticed little changes which make things not quite so special. For instance, the wine is not as pleasant as it used to be, and there used to be a choice of 2 types of red or white. One of our fellow passengers said he could have done with a bit more food. So take some snacks with you for the wee small hours. On the return journey, the dinner was good, but they ran out of beef in premium economy, and there were only 6 of us. We were given food from business, but it was served on a freezing cold plate, and just lacked finesse. I know this is only premium economy, but there were good standards a few years back. The breakfast before landing at Heathrow was horrible, a bagel, with some cream cheese in it and some tooth breaking cereal bars. I must write and complain to BA about their breakfasts, and have done so once, with no effect. I will try again. The staff were very efficient and we felt safe, and there were regular drinks runs, but like many others who travel regularly with BA, we were a little disappointed, and hope that they will be kind enough to listen to their loyal customers of many years.",Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,LHR to YYC,01/10/2016,yes,Verified,2,5,5,3,5,4,4
aircraft are very old,R Christie,05/12/2016,United Kingdom," British Airways from London to Bangkok return. If you are thinking about flying British Airways to Bangkok. Don't do it. Thai Airways or Eva Air for the same price offer a much better service (for direct flights). If you want the best go with Emirates but it's a stop over flight. I fly this route 20 times a year. Here are the key reasons why you should not fly with British Airways. From my experience I believe they overbook flights so they are always full which increases the risk of being uncomfortable and not flying. The aircraft are very old. If you ask for a snack during the flight the staff love to tell you 'Can you wait? service is in 20 mins' this has been tested a few times. They hate anyone who asks for a snack because it starts a chain reaction with other customers. The next service could be in 1 hour but they will still tell you 20 mins. Entertainment is terrible and old and you will also keep accidentally pressing the service button and light with your arm. No phone charger and no USB port. No Wifi.

hit a new low for me,C Draper,04/12/2016,Australia,"  Singapore to Sydney in business class. The price was lowish so we booked—never again. Seat comfort was almost non-existent with appalling ergonomics. The in-flight service hit a new low for me: absolutely shambolic, no team effort, aloof hostesses were openly dismissive of passengers. Food and drink were cut-price and worsened by late wine and bread. No water offered and meal items forgotten. Entertainment choices were sub-par. No noise-cancelling headphones. No cosmetics in the dirty toilets. A dollar-shop amenity bag. I have had better economy experiences than this sector.

closer to low-cost carriers,M Warburton,02/12/2016,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Zurich return using their business class. Online check in and easy access through security at Heathrow. Lounge was overcrowded and not much better than using a coffee shop in the main terminal. Seats onboard A321 are a joke for business class with very small legroom / seat pitch. Food also shows reals signs of cost reduction, and BA is very much closer to low-cost carriers than airlines like Lufthansa or Swiss. Staff service was best described as ""perfunctory"" - they provide F&B and then rest of the flight in the galley chatting very loudly about their Christmas plans.

it was not a pleasant flight,W Cole,30/11/2016,United Kingdom,"  Bassinets by British Airways cater for newborn only. My 10 month old son could not fit in it. The only option was a child seat, however my son sleeps lying flat and will not stay sleeping in the child seat. The only option is to sleep on you. However the arm rests are fixed in and hard. Couple that with the need to breast feed your child, with his poor head and legs crammed in between the seat, either his head would get banged on the armrest or he'd kick the armrest at the other end. It was not a pleasant flight for myself or the child flying from London to Hong Kong. Other airlines offer bassinets up to one years, some even 2 years and also have arm rests that see moveable so that your child is not so constrained in a tiny space for long hours. Imagine a 13 hour flight with your child sleeping on you diagonally length wise because he can't fit in the seat. And every so often you fear he'll fall off your lap. To travel like this for any one or child is ridiculous and British airways refuse to do anything about it.",A380,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to HKG,01/11/2016,no,Verified,2,1,2,-1,3,2,-1

Although the aircraft was relatively old, the seats were comfortable with a generous seat width and pitch. I had a rude shock when I was told I had to be seated in the middle seat of the middle row but it turned out alright. The slack with BA is that we have to purchase a seat if we wanted a specific seat. It is their way of ancillary income. The IFE can be improved as they have very limited offerings.

OK service and flight, but sunlight through the tinted windows was an issue as there are no blinds on the aircraft. I understand some airlines are now coming up with solutions but this is a design flaw on the 787, on a long daytime flight you can't cut out the sunshine, just lower its intensity. Seat layout is poor so almost all seats you will be either needing to climb over someone or have someone climbing over you. Not up to standard.

However the flight itself was good with nice meal and champagne. The cabin service manager was great going around offering drinks frequently for a 3 hour flight this was brilliant.

always hit and mostly miss,2 reviews,27/11/2016,United States," London Heathrow to San Francisco with British Airways. BA was once a classy airline for their first class service, amenities and food. But they have succumbed to the economic pressures to the point their first class service is a lot less than it use to but the price is still absurd even using points. They even hijack you for an additional $1000. Or as I like to say, you cough up 200K in points and the $1000 fee covers their real expense for you to sit in first. They have jammed more seats in so the attendants have more customers. The seat in spite of its new design is tighter and less comfortable for a 6'1"", 240 person to do anything but sit up and watch a movie or hope they do not run out of the food selection on the menu. Second, the staff use to be the most experienced flight attendants but the last two times I flew BA in first I had young attendants who clearly were not use to serving FC customers. A request for say an additional pillow or second cup of coffee went unanswered more than once which is a sign of inexperience. The last trip flying home in April I was handed a menu with a tasting menu or a traditional menu. First class was maybe 50% full. When it was my turn, I asked the flight attendant if I could select some of the tasting menu along with features from the traditional menu - she said she would check and shortly returned to say they were out of the tasting menu items. Now please explain to me how any international first class service could be out of food 10 minutes after leaving the airport? Clearly if they do not have enough for mix or matching then this is a stingy sign of cutbacks on the lowest scale to save a few pennies. At the average price of $10,000 for a first class seat, BA should make damn sure first class has all the food you need. Their menu also talks about late night snacks and on the last two BA first class flights to the US when I wanted to try these snacks they were gone as they are shared with business class. The food served is both uninspiring and generally on the level of US airlines first class which is cooked to death and reheated. Way to go BA, you have sunk to the lowest common denominator. Third, when I arrive in SF and in spite of my luggage having a priority tag, it never comes out in the first batch and often towards the end of the delivery so they have failed on even that count. Unlike the first class asian carriers like Singapore and Cathay where my FC luggage arrives first, BA is always hit and mostly miss. Finally, what galls me is the worthless survey they ask me to fill out describing my FC experience on BA. I let them know everything I said in this review and the last question asked is ""would you like us to call you regarding this review and experience""? Yes, I say and not once has someone called. I am waiting for the day when BA announces ""all passengers including first"" should buy food before boarding and headsets are for sale.",Boeing 747-400,Solo Leisure,First Class,LHR to SFO,01/04/2016,no,Verified,4,3,3,3,2,3,3
the value for money is no longer given,J Caws,25/11/2016,Germany,"  First leg DUS to LHR was Club Europe. While business class has no different seating to economy this aircraft was really a joke. It was completely outdated and worst of all it seems to be not cleaned before the flight. Crumbs on the seat. Table was sticky. Asking crew members they apologize and are very friendly and tried to help with cleaning. Overall crew on this flight was extremly friendly. Next leg from LHR to BOS very similar experience: Business class was upgraded with an outstanding new IFE but seats are still old. The housing of my seat was taped with gaffa tape next to the footstool. Asking crew about that they told me that the housing fell off and engineering was not able to fix it so they used gaffa tape. In general the 747-400 looks quite a bit dated and might need a further upgrade rather than the IFE and some smaller details (e.g. carpet should be replaced - extremely dirty and roved). Lounge in LHR very outdated. Boarding in LHR was somewhat uncoordinated as a lot of people don't listen to the announcements and try to board and impede boarding of other persons. Crew on board once again very friendly and effective. Meal choice was ok. But my impression is that quality is going down, e.g. beef was very fibrous and vegetable was somewhat overcooked. Club Kitchen -> long time an outstanding feature of BA is a joke nowadays. Selection seems to go down every time I fly. Worst of all: One of my bags did not made it to the aircraft. This itself can happen and is not a problem at all but the handling of this was a real joke. After identifying that my bag seems to be lost I went to the counter (even if finding it is not that easy in Boston). I explained my problem and the lady looked in the computer and said that I did not checked another bag -> although I had my tag that I could show to her. I had to discuss with her for several minutes and had to ask for the manager on duty in order to get a baggage claim written. Manager on duty was very unfriendly and except for writing the claim he did not provided any additional help. No apologies for inconvience at all. Last year I had one bag that was delayed. This handling was done by another person and was completely different experience. Extremely helpful and really sorry about the inconvience. Summarizing: Flying BA for business for many years and on a regular basis now. The changes under the new boss can be seen. While in the past British Airways was really good it seems to decline from month to month. This time flight was one of the worst I ever had with BA. I assume that if there is no change in the near term I will choose another airline in future e.g. a low cost carrier as there is not that much difference any more. If you read a lot of the other reviews you will see that I am not the only one thinking like this.

The Concorde Lounge was well staffed and the food and wine was exquisite. I was welcomed to the First Class cabin by an enthusiastic cabin crew. There was a slight delay on taking off which was made easier with a second glass of champagne. Throughout the flight and cabin crew achieved the perfect balance of being friendly, helpful and interested as well as anticipating what I needed. The food was to a high standard and my wine glass was kept topped up. After dinner, the crew member assigned to me, a mirthful Frenchman, made my bed and I had six hours sleep to wake up to breakfast consisting of fruit followed by a full English.

a worn out and low cost discount carrier,B Pearson,23/11/2016,Thailand,"  I booked and bought an online ticket for a multi destination 6 week trip that took me from Bangkok to London, Angola, London, Nigeria, London and back to Bangkok. Before purchase I called the British Airways service number on website and asked if I needed to change rearrange dates with this ticket was that OK - was told 'yes but have to pay a £150 fee', and nothing else a little steep but OK. I further checked extra's would be against the Visa card used to purchase the ticket, 'of course' was the reply. BA make you pay to book a specific seat now. The trip started okay but the aircraft used on the Bangkok flight very worn and old - anyway got through to 3rd leg visiting Nigeria for 12 days business and looked like I could arrange to come home earlier - fired up the BA app on internet roaming service to find its not possible to re-book on the APP as indicated - not given any local number to call - search out possible BA numbers - to find they no longer have an office in Nigeria and get onto what transpires to be their call centre in India. Operator checks there is space on an earlier flight but then announces he has to check the additional cost to come up with an extra of £1000+. I decline this option and explain the £150 as advised (actually APP says change cost is £0). Later BA call centre call back and say they can offer a reduced cost - hustling for business like they are haggling in an open market - however for this option it would not be possible to take payment by Visa. It had to be paid in cash to only a single bank branch in Abuja (during bank open hours) - some 6 hours and 300Km's away. By now I had readjusted to fly on the original dates fuming with BA over the mis sold flight and ridiculous impractical conditions they try and enforce. Taking this up with BA complaints - takes 2 month to elicit a first response - to be dealt with on one sided website. They do not take responsibility for the advice given over the phone, will not acknowledge any shortcomings of their APP refusing to discuss it and failure to advise on their very special conditions that apply to their Nigerian flights. My return flight to Bangkok on a tired sunken seat with bent worn and distorted table closures and scratched video screen topped by the sight of BA cabin staff too short and rotund to be able to reach and close the overhead lockers before take off - and persuading a bemused passenger out his seat to do this for them that this is not the former 'flag carrier' but a worn out and low cost discount carrier.

a total embarrassment,W Peters,22/11/2016,United Kingdom," London Gatwick to Barbados with British Airways. BA now stands for Budget Airways. Having flown BA for many years in all classes from first to economy, I could not believe how everything has declined so drastically. I was offered a drink, no snacks were offered, as in the past. There was a choice of 2 meals, a pasta and sausages and mash, by the time it got to me there was only one meal on offer, I was refused a second bottle of wine with the meal. Before arrival in Barbados afternoon tea was a mini Twix bar, I took 2 and was ordered to put one back. The earphones for the inflight entertainment were so uncomfortable and kept falling out of my ears. The return flight was no better with breakfast before arrival being just an inedible bun.

food not great and entertainment options poor,Mary Clarke,21/11/2016,United Kingdom," Flew British Airways from Johannesburg to London Heathrow. Travelled several times in Business Class but booked First Class this time. Outgoing flight on 747 seats surprisingly cramped (centre seats), food not great and entertainment options poor but great bed made up for this. Yesterday's flight on A380 also disappointing but seats much better (centre seats). Entertainment better. Food quality very poor. My starter of vegetable tart had uncooked pastry on the bottom. I returned my main course of fillet steak because it was vastly overcooked and the potato/cheese thing uncooked. The 'chef' told me all meals arrived in packs and were just heated up. He could not alter the cooking time for the steak. I had a very ordinary salmon fillet instead. The sweet was just two slices of Madeira cake with a spoon of jam and a spoon of something white. The breakfast muesli was horrible and the French toast was inedible. The wine didn't seem to be what was described and the orange juice seemed out of a carton. The First Class lounge experience was very business class at the most. Will not travel BA first again. Felt very rushed in the morning with staff desperate to serve breakfast not giving chance for people to wake up and get dressed.",A380,Couple Leisure,First Class,JNB to LHR,01/11/2016,no,Verified,5,5,3,1,2,1,3
low-cost airline standard,K Yasimov,21/11/2016,United Kingdom,"  Sofia to London Heathrow, and the flight was on time. However cabin interior is awful, seats are cramped and uncomfortable. On board service quality has declined on BA flights and this flight was not exception. Offered food was only a sandwich (compared to hot meal recently) - it's a joke. Economy Class complimentary service will end soon. Cabin crew was just OK, but I’m giving 2 stars because they can’t be much greater than the level of services provided. Our luggage was delayed 45 mins at Heathrow Terminal 5. BA now offering low-cost airline standard - the only difference is price, it's more expensive which makes poor value for money. I'm still using BA regularly and I can see the obvious downgrade in standards during the last 2-3 years and even more dramatic decline in 2016.

do not know if I will fly again,16 reviews,14/11/2016,Portugal," London to Lisbon with British Airways. Very bad flight, when a person does not want to check in baggage it is because he packed to not waste time in the luggage pick up. My luggage was taken during the boarding procedure because they said the flight was full, yes it was but there was enough space to all to have the mini trolley that I had in the plane, and people that I must say had bigger luggage then my own. Once in the plane fast exit from Heathrow and once on flight a bag of chips, or peanuts, very healthy. On the arrival at Lisbon plane parked near the Military Aerodrome on Portela (Figo Maduro), and 10 minutes bus ride to the terminal and more 10 minutes to wait for luggage.

I will no longer fly with BA,Matthew Jefrrey,14/11/2016,United Kingdom,"  Recently flew a return trip with BA to Miami onboard one of their A380 aircraft, and what has happened to this airline! Outbound flight delayed 1 hour once we had boarded due to a broken seatbelt which should have been spotted during turnaround. Having flown the route several times on the 747 we were looking forward to trying the A380. We were seated in row 31 which is the last row in the mid section just before the central galley area. From the moment we sat down there was a dreadful whine coming from the wall behind us! Upon asking the crew if this would stop they said they it was the fridges in the galley and once the engines started we wouldn't hear it. This went on for 9 hours and the crew issued us ear plugs to wear and said that the noise was ""normal"" on all their A380 aircraft. The food was horrid and only a choice of 2 meals. I chose a curry which had no flavour and was incredibly greasy. The return flight was a different A380 which had the same awful noise but it did stop around 2 hours prior to arrival. The food on the return was as disgusting as on the outbound leg and as for the ""breakfast"" it consisted of a cold bagel type thing with one blob of cream cheese in the middle. The standards have dropped so far it is incredible. I'm certain if I sat in row 31 on Emirates or the like I wouldn't be issued with ear plugs. I'm booked to Miami once more in early 2017, fortunately on a quiet 747 and after that I will no longer fly with BA.",A380-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to MIA,01/10/2016,no,Verified,1,3,3,1,2,2,1

another underwhelming experience,Clive Drake,13/11/2016,United Kingdom,"  The flight started in the First Class Concorde lounge at T5. It is certainly showing signs of wear with tacky material hanging down around some of the seats. The seat cushions need refilling. The general ambiance is quite good. A refurbishment is long overdue. The food quality and choice is generally quite poor - although the Crab Tortellini was good. Nobody invited us to choose from the menu or to offer drinks. I had to walk the floor and find someone. All sloppy. The menus also were worn and scruffy and someone, a child I think, had scribbled on the inside, some funny cartoons. We boarded and the flight departed to the minute. All good. The Boeing 787 has a small 1st Class and I realized that the space also is smaller than the 777 option. The 747 alternative is a total disaster and I go to great lengths to avoiding flying their 747s. Food was OK. Very little wow factor. The meze was fine. They ran out of Cod - and at this point I don't think we had hit the cruise. Seven from eight passenger - and only one Cod apparently. I had the lamb which was alright but on short night flights I prefer not to have meat. My wife's allocated seat was - broken, hence the vacant seat on the flight. So she sat one side of the plane and I sat the other. Brilliant. The plane was only six months old. Given the competition on this route you would think BA would want to impress. Was it a coincidence I wonder that there was no Arabic or Asian passengers on the flight? With Emirates on this route - why would there be? We landed on time and then had to walk miles. Another underwhelming experience with BA. I wonder what those who spent £3,000.00 one way thought.",Boeing 787,Family Leisure,First Class,LHR to DXB,01/11/2016,no,Verified,5,3,4,2,2,2,3
underwhelming due to bean counters,Clive Drake,12/11/2016,United Kingdom,"  The flight started badly in the so called new Concorde lounge at Dubai. I have reviewed this in the lounge section. The situation was worsened by a three hour delay to our departure. Apparently minimum rest period had been compromised. Not sure if this was true but we ended up with a 787 crew not a 777 crew. On the 777 the First seating is double that of a 787 and result was we were served, the entire full cabin of 17 - by one FA. He did his best but must have walked about 10 miles in the flight trying to keep us happy. The Boeing 777 first seat is the largest of the three options (747/787/747). Mine was starting to show signs of wear. No amuse bouche. As announced last month BA have cut back this cost. Wow, a £3 saving on a £3,00o one way ticket. Well done BA. Champagne was lukewarm, as is often the case. Lamb and fennel salad appetizer was ghastly. Horrible in fact. The soup was the usual Butternut squash soup (do they offer anything else or am I unlucky) and was lukewarm but okay. The apricot chicken was pleasant enough but I could not taste any apricot. A bistro product at best. Later in the flight I had afternoon tea - sandwiches. All dry and tasteless. Watched a movie on the inflight entertainment system and this was fine. Nodded off and had two hour nap which was nice. Landed without being stacked for a change. As one comes to expect with BA, underwhelming due to the bean counters at LHR cutting back - as well as increasing fares. I'd like to see the entire BA board removed and a new dynamic team of men and women with vision and inspiration for our national carrier.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,First Class,DXB to LHR,01/11/2016,no,Verified,2,3,4,1,2,2,3

This particular Boeing 747 had clearly had its day, but was infinitely better than my return flight on the A380. I paid an additional fee for my seat but irrespective, felt ""packed in"".

Goodbye British Airways,C Drake,08/11/2016,United Kingdom,"  London Gatwick to Mauritius return. Our outbound flight had certainly not been memorable, but new to British Airways we were prepared to wait and see. The inbound flight commented upon here was much worse, but with many facets of the earlier experience.  We paid two supplements for the flights. A substantial fee to upgrade from Economy and a very unpopular one to ensure as elderly clients - on overnight flights - we could sit together! The combined cost therefore was significant. The benefits were not. Firstly, upon being seated we were faced with a cabin crew apparently in a bad mood. A lady ahead of us had a headrest problem, she was rudely dealt with and seemed intimidated.  Throughout the flight during waking hours, passengers seemed to be a nuisance. Food - as we had flown this class on other scheduled airlines, we were expecting a menu to select meals. How silly. Here the economy trolley brought appalling food with a twin choice - chicken or veg (a bright green Risotto). So, no Choice! No bread roll, no cheese and bikkies, a 'choice' of one red wine, and plastic cutlery. This was served after the attention in Economy, and may account for the absence of choice. Whatever, it was awful. It was noticeable how many meals remained uneaten. What a waste of resources. Significantly better quality has been had on holiday airline journeys of shorter duration. The Premium Economy (WTPlus) cabin had no provision for toilets. It was necessary to go forward to Club, or back to Economy! It became clear early-on that going forward was not popular with those in that cabin, so back it was! During the night, with passenger debris in aisles, this was hazardous with shiny plastic bags (from headphone containers) to slip on. Is nobody in British Airways capable of seeing the provision of a loo for 24 passengers is essential?  On arrival in UK we read that BA is to put even more seats in Economy class on this type of aircraft.

Was excited to try the Boeing 787 and new first on this special occasion trip. Cabin intimate with 8 semi private suites. Look good with nice finishing touches of leather and chrome, but seats quite narrow. Champagne before take off. Nice crew but slightly inexperienced and not totally familiar with aircraft type. Main meal was very average. Scallops overcooked and main beef part overcooked on one side. Breakfast ok. Bed for sleeping comfortable but too narrow. Power outlets wouldn't work with my iPhone or iPad. Table for dinner wouldn't extend properly and reading light fell out of its socket - on a new aircraft?

nothing short of a joke,Martin Roper,07/11/2016,United Kingdom,"  First time using British Airways as always flown Virgin but routes from Orlando to Gatwick were full with Virgin. The flight was cancelled with no reason for 24 hours. No apologies, a text message sent to my phone 4 hours before departure with no telephone or contact number. After an hour of ringing everybody I could at BA I ended up being passed to an offshore call centre. If you deal with BA this will be where you call for everything - cut off three times and completely incoherent. I was traveling with my wife and 9 year old daughter in ""Club World"" seating. The plane was over 18 years old and whilst serviceable, it was in a dire state. My daughter commented ""this is like a dustbin with wings daddy"" when we got into the cabin. On arrival to my ""Club World"" bed it had a large piece of plastic that had fallen from somewhere. I handed it to a stewardess who said ""that bit isn't important"" whilst looking down at me and taking it away. The inflight system was a joke, the resolution on the screen made it almost impossible to see anything. All the pixels were broken. The charging for laptops etc was US only and the remote for the entertainment system didn't work. An announcement came on before we left ""we have a passenger travelling with us that has a serious nut allergy. Please do not eat any nuts at anytime"". Once we had taken off we were served warm wine with a large bag of mixed nut! I am proud to be British, but I am incredibly embarrassed for British Airways to represent my country in such a poor way.

According to the duty manager, they regularly oversell the premium cabins and staff are fed up with apologising to angry passengers. We were given £300 each travel vouchers as compensation, so it means we have to use British Airways again. We ended up in World Traveller plus (premium economy).

It is reliable and safe but the attitude of the cabin staff put me off. It therefore came as a pleasant surprise that this seems to have changed. The stewardesses were very friendly and attentive. The aircraft was a Boeing 787 with a seat configuration of 3+3+3 which was good. In-flight entertainment was very good and it worked. Boarding at Seoul Incheon airport was surprisingly quick.

The flight deck did a great job in getting us there safely and they were informative without being over bearing with their announcements. The service on board was very good, the food was plentiful and quite tasty. The inflight entertainment was excellent. Loads of choices and great quality. All in all a great experience.

I was booked on Air Canada but rebooked onto British Airways as I was unable to make the AC flight since AC cancelled an earlier flight from YYJ to YVR. Having flown British Airways in the past, I was looking forward to flying them again, but my trip was somewhat disappointing. Seat on the Boeing 747 not the most comfortable, but still a slightly bit better than on Air Canada's 10 across Boeing 777-300ER. Meal served after takeoff was chicken with rice - it was fairly tasteful. Cabin crew seemed approachable, but after the meal service, cabin crew disappeared and made very limited appearances during the 9.5 hr flight to London. I wanted a glass of water and had to push the call button - then waited over 15 minutes until a cabin crew walked by. Before landing, breakfast was served - consisting of a tasteless pretzel bun and granola bar.

The seat was comfortable with ample legroom, the food was excellent for airline food and both ground staff and flight crew were friendly and efficient. The flight was quiet and smooth, on time and made up time on the flight. The only downside was that the inflight entertainment stopped working after one hour, despite the crews efforts it could not be restored for the remainder of the flight. We did note one steward enter the premium economy cabin with a list and upgraded about 15 people into business, the rest of us went without for 8 hours. It worked fine on the return journey and I guess it's just one of those things, just annoyed me that a certain selected few were upgraded and the rest ignored.",A380,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,LHR to MIA,01/10/2016,yes,Verified,2,4,5,4,5,4,1
don't make same mistake as me,P Hardiman,27/10/2016,Belgium,"  I am tall, 196cm to be exact. That's why on a recent flight from London to Brussels I couldn't face being crammed into a microscopic economy seat. Instead I decided to pay £385 to fly in British Airways ""Business"" class. What a mistake! On arrival to Heathrow's Terminal 5 I tried to enter the queue at zone B as directed by one of the information signs. I was told that the staff had decided to close that so I had to go somewhere else. I joined the queue at ""C"" instead but was told when I got to the front that business class checked in at H. I made my way to British Airways business class lounge, which was crowded, dirty with wet smelly bathrooms that looked more like a run-down bus station than an airline's lounge. The place was wildly understaffed which meant that there were used plates, cutlery and half eaten food littering tables in the room. It was far less crowed in the rest of the terminal which is where I waited for my flight. The gate was announced and I made my way to gate 10C where the flight was being bussed. I was in seat 3D. It was not a business class seat at all but an economy seat with almost zero legroom. The whole point of spending £385 was legroom and I didn't have any. I asked the flight attendant if anything could be done.  BA would not have been my choice anyway but I do understand that given tight schedules and limited choice sometime you are forced to fly with a particular company against your better judgment. In that case don't make the same mistake as me. British Airways.",A319,Business,Business Class,LHR to BRU,01/10/2016,no,Verified,3,1,1,1,1,1,1

Security even more busy with Ryanair and Easyjet passengers going through priority/ fast track. Flight ok with warm food (chicken in mushroom veloute or beef with crushed potatoes - also with mushroom!) and enough champagne to make one feel sleepy. Saying that if you have a mushroom allergy beware as there is no option to pre-order your meal online or over the phone for that specific allergy - BA should do something about this. Annoying passengers as per usual when using LGW - for me that's a holiday airport with people who don't fly often yet they claim to be the Alfa and omega of flying (to the point that we were told off by people behind us for reclining our seats and I quote ""obviously you don't fly much"" - us being silver with BA and gold with LH...).

Crew were very friendly but not very attentive when it came to service so I never got a welcome drink. The seat was the standard Club World seat which is ok for lying down or sitting full up right, anything in between feel awkward. The food was bordering inedible with especially the steak cooked beyond all recognition. As always BA's lack of dine on demand and inflight snacks were showing (the Club kitchen is getting worse each flight it seems). However the meal service is reasonably quick at just over 2 hours from take off and a significant improvement on the outbound flight. The inflight entertainment selection is quite good but the screen are small and terrible and the cabin as a whole could benefit from a total over hall. Pre-landing snacks were better than the main service but still not worth writing about. Crew were friendly through out the flight but again not very attentive by missing out drinks servings. If I had not managed to get the tickets at a heavily discounted price I would have felt cheated on both the hard and soft product provided.

I fly this route often as I have a home in Tuscany. When I first flew this route (as opposed to Ryanair) on arrival you had an air bridge which made it a more satisfactory experience. Now, as a cost cutting exercise - you don't. Which means if its raining you get wet. which we did. The BA LGW Club lounge is closed and we went to a temporary set up at the North terminal. It was fine. Very busy - but the light lunch was better than BA's own set up - the last time we used it. Plane left 40 minutes late as we were stuck on the apron waiting for a slot. I settled for a couple of G&Ts - and my wife had the afternoon tea which she said was fine. On the return the ""Club Europe"" lines at Pisa check in were used by just about anyone. It was a zoo. The BA airport crew didn't care and given the management at BA don't care about customer service and quality, why should they? Lunch was quite pleasant, some sort of Chicken dish. We got stacked for 15 minutes which is annoying. On both flights I got the front row which gave more legroom. The seats? Well the usual abysmal so called ""Club Europe."" A disaster and only worth the money if you buy them in a sale. FAs in both directions were splendid. They get very embarrassed about talking about BA cutbacks. Who wouldn't?

cost cutting to extreme levels,M Ghislandi,23/10/2016,United Kingdom,"  Tokyo Haneda to London, and British Airways is cost cutting all the time! I was extremely disappointed with the onboard catering. For a 12 hours flight there were no mid flight snacks or food. The tuck box vanished from your offering. We got served a small breakfast at departure (9am Tokyo time) and nothing until 90 minutes before landing. Pretty much 10 hours with no food!  So not only the food available seems to have been reduced but it is also very poorly timed.  It looks like despite BA's good profits, they are cost cutting to extreme levels. Perhaps the CEO could try out this sector in World Traveller or World Traveller Plus (rather the the First class he probably uses on a long haul flight) and see how he feels at the end of it!

had a perfectly satisfactory flight,3 reviews,23/10/2016,United Kingdom,"  I had a perfectly satisfactory flight with British Airways to Boston and back this month (Oct 2016). I slept most of the way had a nibble at the food the quality of which might be declining although at altitude my taste buds are pathetic and had no alcohol. The only reason I fly first class is that the beds are more comfortable than club world and I dislike the club seating arrangement. Apart from breakfast scrambled eggs I hardly eat on long haul. Generally speaking, the cabin crews are good and attentive and it's a bonus if you get some ex Concorde crew. I never want to board the aircraft early as I know that I will not have trouble stowing my bags in first.

listening to cabin crew moaning,R Wood,22/10/2016,United Kingdom,"  San Francisco to Manchester via Heathrow. Marginal improvement from the outbound leg of this journey. A 2 year old A380, the seats were much nicer than the 777-200 outbound flight - seat 82a, I did like the extra storage bin to the side of the seat by the window which freed up room on the floor (can't say if that's a good thing for BA or standard on this aircraft though as it was my first A380 flight). That's the positives out of the way. No sense of organisation to the boarding process just 400 folk stood by a gate. Cabin crew looked uninterested during boarding. 7pm departure so I was looking forward to getting a meal and getting to sleep early to try get back on uk time as best as I could. At 9:30pm meal arrived, no choice offered and bits missing of both mine and my partners meals. I got a bread roll she didn't, she got a dessert I didn't, neither of us got a drink and by gosh it was a travesty I had the cheek to ask a member of cabin crew for a Diet Coke! Woke for breakfast after a few hours sleep and instantly regretted it. A folded omelette 2.5 potato wedges and a cherry tomato, (breakfast of kings). The final couple of hours was spent watching the interactive map to see how long I had left to suffer and listening to the cabin crew in the back moaning about various things in their personal lives. The 20 minute call came from the captain and crew hurriedly prepared the cabin for landing. My quick connecting flight to Manchester was pretty much the same too. If I could rate things as 0 stars I would. I'm ashamed British Airways is my national carrier.",A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,SFO to MAN via LHR,01/10/2016,no,Verified,3,2,1,1,1,1,1
never again British Airways,C Drew,20/10/2016,United Kingdom,"  Manchester to San Francisco via Heathrow. First time flying with British Airways and will most certainly be my last. 11 hour flight from London Heathrow to San Francisco on a very very tired looking Boeing 777-200 was not what I had expected. IFE system was sparse in choice and colour pixels on the screen. Couldn't sit with my partner as unlike most ""leading carriers"", BA opt for a system of charging if you want to reserve a seat before check in opens? When check in did open we were assigned seats miles apart and the plane was fully booked - so 11 hours of no real IFE and the option to talk to my partner involved a 5 minute walk across the plane. We could have opted to go with Virgin cheaper but decided it would be nice to go with BA. Who as far as I can work out are on Ryanair's level of additional charges.

lost my patience with BA,Sandeep Mander,20/10/2016,United Kingdom,"  After many years of flying on BA, being a gold member for the last 6 years, I have finally lost my patience with BA.  There is no point BA even having a customer relations team as it seems there hands are now firmly tied to be able to do anything for a loyal customer when things go wrong. I recently spent over £4000 on a flight to Singapore, outbound being First and inbound in Club World. The plane was a fairly new A380 and on the outbound journey, the plane developed issues in the toilets where the toilets were not be drained properly. The crew on board did their best looking after things but still wasn’t a very pleasant experience from the passengers (and the crew might I add!).  On the Inbound a few days later, we were delayed by 3 hours because of a pump issue in the toilets where there was no running water throughout the entire plane (must have been the same aircraft as the outbound). The ground crew did everything to try and fix it because they didn’t feel it was fair departing on a 13 hour voyage with no running water in the toilets. It meant no running water to flush the toilet (although the suction system still worked), and not running taps to clean ourselves, and of course no tea of coffee facilities. 3 hours had passed and the crew decided to depart anyway, the answer was to load the plane with loads of bottled water and wipes in the toilets but no tea or coffees throughout the whole journey (they had to get the plane to land back at LHR just before the 3 hour delay to stop each passengers claiming 300 EUR under the EU compensation policy (the plane landed back to LHR 2hr 54 min late!). To top things off, after landing back to LHR, the ground crew from BA forgot to tell the airport ground crew of a late gate change which resulted in the bags delivery being delayed by a further 1hr 30 min. So in summary, I get home 5 hours later than planned with toilet issues on the outbound, which created a bit of a smell around the whole aircraft, and toilet issues on the way back delaying the plane and making an uncomfortable journey on the way back and seriously delaying my arrival back home with the baggage issues added to it. Everyone has the right to get a decent amount of compensation in this situation regardless of the class they are travelling in - the answer from BA customer relations was 15,000 Avios Points! What’s 15,000 going to get me? Surely I ask you can do more and the lovely lady on the phone (who seems embarrassed herself having to tell me) couldn’t do anymore as the supervisor’s decision is final. Can I speak to the supervisor I ask? (I am thinking as a loyal member spending so much on BA he/she might have the decency to speak to me), the answer was no, they don’t speak to anyone.",A380,Business,First Class,LHR to SIN,01/10/2016,no,Verified,9,4,4,3,1,1,3
Very poor service,Zafrullah Hamzah,15/10/2016,Ireland,"  London Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur. Very poor service. This is their much vaunted Boeing 787 first class. Could not book a massage in their lounge despite trying to book 3 weeks in advance. The cabana in their lounge was smelly and had no clear partition from the toilet/ shower. Nobody bothered to check if I needed anything.Priority boarding was a joke. Outbound service on board was mediocre. Cabin crew slow to anticipate passengers' needs. No Wifi. One toilet and the same size as in a low cost airline. Food OK but not great. On arrival I asked the chief stewardess about fast track only to be brushed off with ""we don't do fast track here"". Return flight was equally poor. Rang the bell and no one came. Rang again after an hour to order breakfast. Stewardess came and said ""of course but we start serving from the other side"". So much for first class dining on demand. The only great part of the trip was the first class lounge in Kuala Lumpur, thanks to Malaysia Airlines as it is their lounge and NOT British Airways .

they are unreliable ,Charles Berger,11/10/2016,United States,"  Washington Dulles to Nairobi via London. Was excited to fly First Class on BA from Dulles to Nairobi, since it's about 15 hours of flying time I decided to splurge on a 1st Class ticket. Things started off poorly at checkin when BA's computer system went down  a seemingly constant problem ) . After 45 minutes of waiting, they were finally able to get a back up system going and I was checked in and off to their Lounge. Great meal and service there. My flying companion didn't want to splurge on a 1st Class ticket so she was in Business Class. It wasn't long after we boarded that she came forward to report that their business class seating was the worst she's seen. BA has this squirrelly layout where passengers sit forwards and backwards on the flight, meaning that you lack privacy and someone may have to step over you when you're asleep. Well I sprung for an $850 upgrade for her and all was well. Until the captain announced that there was an unmatched bag on board and it had to be removed before we could depart. Here's where BA's systems again breaks down and their computer isn't working to locate the bag in the hull. 3.5 hours later they locate the bag and we take off. We land 3 hours late at Heathrow and miss our connection to Nairobi! No one to assist you; head off to another terminal to customer service, wait 30-40 minutes in line to be told that they can put you on a Kenyan Air flight business class in 8 hours or you can wait til the next day and fly out on BA. We chose Kenya Airways and arrived the next morning without one checked bag. On our return flight I had booked a business class ticket and asked if they would upgrade me since I couldn't use my 1st class ticket. No, can't do that and you'll have to apply for a refund. Meanwhile they upgraded a couple of passengers gratis! I was told later that that is ""promotional"" and to hell with a paying passenger. The bottom line is, don't fly BA if you are going on to a distant location, they are unreliable and assistance is negligible.

not customer focussed in any way whatsoever,R Nelson,11/10/2016,United Kingdom,"  Flew Malaga to Gatwick. Although a better flight than two weeks ago the 'service' of a small packet of crisps, peanuts or biscuit is a disgrace. At least with other airlines you can purchase food. Passengers were hungry and cabin staff were clearly embarrassed with the megre offering. For our national carrier to go to this low base and makes a mockery of 'To fly-to serve'. We will choose any other airline over British Airways in future - human cargo are clearly an inconvenience for the BA management (although the cabin staff did their very best). No doubt BA management can't wait to get their hands on more of our money when they start to supply food at a charge.

this is a humourless service,Peter Cleland,07/10/2016,United Kingdom,"  
Come on British Airways. Really. I have flown BA long haul on two journeys in the last four weeks. First from LIM-LHR and now LHR-DEN. I know that BA has refurbished some of their B747-400 and B777 but the rest are a disgrace. As a flag carrier, what message does this send to the rest of the world? On a positive note, the cabin crew are always polite (sometimes to the point of being passive-aggressive), but this is a humourless service. Even London Underground has moved from the dated uniforms. The in-flight catering is lack-lustre. I choose vegan because the standard meals are truly awful. You now even have to pay for the snacks between meals (unlike KLM or LATAM). I understand the economics are difficult, given that some nations subsidise flag carriers, but small and low-cost changes would make a major difference. Firstly, smarten up the staff (have you seen the LAN uniforms?). On the last flight, one crew member hadn't shaved and it wasn't designer stubble. Get some humour training into the crew and just make passengers flight comfortable. The IFS systems are so dated that they match the reruns of old BBC sitcoms/ soaps offered. On a positive note: 1) I believe BA is a safe airline and the crew professional. Big bonus point for me. 2) When there is a problem, BA is efficient in sorting it out. 3) Communication from the cockpit is usually good.",Boeing 747-400,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to DEN,01/10/2016,yes,Verified,2,3,2,1,3,3,1
plane was clearly dated,24 reviews,05/10/2016,Portugal,"  Flew British Airways from Boston to London Heathrow. The plane was clearly dated - judging by the old IFE screens and even some rust here and there - but the plane was clean, the crew were extremely nice and polite. The food was good, although I would say the light meal just before arrival could have been a bit more substantial. Overall, it was a nice flight. A note on the ground service: the way it is set up - with a line for bag drop among others and multiple counters that can call for this and that spread out - leads to some people not hearing being called. I could clearly hear the staff annoyingly saying ""I have called them and they are not listening so I am not doing it anymore"". I really think it is not nice, given the distance between the counters and the lines and the natural noise on an airport terminal.",Boeing 747,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BOS to LHR,01/10/2016,yes,Verified,1,4,5,4,2,4,4

indifferent attitudes of cabin service,Jeffrey Davies,03/10/2016,United States,"  Flew British Airways to/from Heathrow recently as first experience. Have read a number of previous reviews commenting about the indifferent attitudes of cabin service. I absolutely agree, and what a shame. But BA, if you actually read some of these reviews, you can actually retrain and improve our perceptions quickly. When boarding, rather than just pointing to which aisle to begin walking down, actually have your cabin staff positioned (even in economy!) to assist passengers struggling to load carry on baggage and to get seated and out of the way of others. Many of us are unfamiliar with the somewhat different controls on the newer 777's. Perhaps a handout as we board or a bit of cabin assistance? On long transatlantic flights, cabin stewards disappear for at least 4-5 hours mid flight. Perhaps an occasional trip down the cabin once every hour or two to ask if customers need anything? (Or are they fearful of the extra work?).",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,LHR to ATL,01/10/2016,no,Verified,4,3,2,3,2,3,3

The English Breakfast choice was a pleasant surprise until this last flight, on which the reduction of portion size and quality was noticeable. The pre landing snack had always been a decent chicken salad sandwich, but on this flight, it was a cookie - maybe two; I forget. The cabin crew was efficient and friendly, and the AVOD was excellent, much improved from the older 747's, which we have had on the route.

My husband and I were flying to Mauritius for our second anniversary from Gatwick Airport. The staff were rude and inattentive. I pressed the flight attendant button so many times, and after waiting 20 mins, they just switched it off. However, that was not the worst of it - the flight was so cold. We asked if they could please turn it up (they didn't care), multiple passengers asked for extra blankets (not that it would help). I was literally shaking the whole flight through, even though I had multiple layers of clothes on. I will never fly direct to Mauritius with British Airways.

not fit for purpose,Gregory Burton,30/09/2016,United Kingdom," Here I am again after my previous review 2 weeks ago of specifically the British Airways online check in system. I am currently in Cyprus on holiday and will be flying back to London this evening with my elderly Mother. We sat next to each other last night at 1930 and opened our BA apps on our phones at the same time. My Mother had a choice of 12 seats (on a 300 seat Boeing 767), and I had a choice of just 4 seats. Again. So clear evidence of passenger inequality at BA, even though the passengers are travelling in the same cabin class. This happened 2 weeks ago when flying from London Heathrow to Larnaca. Firstly, why do I, who flies several times a year with BA, only get 4 (very poor location) seats to ""choose"" from, and another BA Economy passenger gets a choice of 12 seats to choose from? Secondly, why do BA offer an online check in service which is not fit for purpose? When I fly with Aeroflot, you can choose your seat at the time you actually book your tickets. As it should be with every airline. But BA appear to suffer from some kind of 'seat hoarding' issue for some reason. I presume they would rather people pay the £15 to choose a seat in advance on top of the already high price of their tickets, something I personally will never ever do.",Boeing 767,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LCA to LHR,01/09/2016,no,Verified,1,3,3,3,2,2,1

The was our first experience on BA's A380 and it was very comfortable and relaxing. We usually fly Etihad from Australia to LHR but this time decided to try BA. The boarding at Singapore was efficient friendly and on time. As this was a late evening flight (2320) we just wanted to get settled and into bed as soon as possible. We made this point to the crew and they were fantastic in making this happen as soon as they were permitted to set up the beds. The config of First Class in BA is 1-2-1 with 2 aisles. This is not as good as the Etihad First which has a central aisle with individual cabins (called apartments) of the aisle. Never the less the seats were fine for flat bed sleeping if a little narrow.

Our preferred airline is Etihad but we decided to try BA as we secured a very competitive First fare. I have never flown BA before but have heard not so good reports, so was a bit apprehensive. We were delighted with the service from Qantas (BA flys out of SYD) in Melbourne in booking our bags through to Singapore. The boarding in SYD was very smooth and we were warmly welcomed by the very professional cabin crew. The 777 First is a 1-2-1 configuration and we had the centre seats with the drop down privacy screen. Departure (1500) was on time and the 9 hour flight up to Singapore was very smooth.

I was unable to select a seat,Tony Banwait,28/09/2016,United States,"  San Jose - London Heathrow - San Jose in September 2016 in Premium Economy. Was so excited when British Airways announced the new San Jose service earlier this year. Driving up the 101 to SFO had become a tedious task with traffic getting more and more congested. So was relieved to book out of SJC, a ten minute drive from home. My only one gripe with BA is not being able to select a seat at time of booking without paying an additional fee which should not be necessary in Premium Economy. Night before travel, I was unable to select a seat during on-line check-in, so next day I proceeded to the airport only to be told no seat was available due to over-booking. Was provided an $800 compensation credit card to fly the following day which I gladly accepted. The Boeing 787 is a beautiful quiet airplane and a good choice of aircraft for this route. Was given juice upon boarding and a hot towel. Only one drink service after take-off and only one shot of whiskey was provided. Dinner service included a choice from the Club World cabin menu. Full English breakfast prior to landing. Return trip, given glass of champagne upon boarding and hot towel. Lunch was a Filet of Beef. Mid-flight snack box was a let down and afternoon tea included a pizza. Cabin crew were OK and nothing exceptional on both sectors.

feel of a budget carrier,E Ivers,27/09/2016,New Zealand,"  Bahrain to Boston via London. First time flying BA after flying Qatar, Emirates and Oman Air business class. Check in at BAH was quick and efficient with their seperate business and first class check in area. BA uses the Dilmun lounge, which is basic but adequate. The flight from BAH to LHR was on a 777. The seats are in a 2x4x2 configuration and are very narrow (similar to premium economy seats, and marginally larger than the economy seats) though reasonably comfortable. When fully flat there is not much room, and people over 6 feet will struggle. There was hardly any storage space, and the IFE screen was very small and of poor quality. The food was very average (I had the carrot and pumpkin soup). Cabin crew was disengaged and the plane felt old and tired. The lounge in Heathrow is large, but gets too busy to be able to sit comfortably. The bathrooms in both the main BA lounges are quite dated and need a good clean far more often then they get. The quality of food in the lounge is average, though the wine and spirit selection is decent. The flight from LHR to BOS was on a 747 and this was similar to the 777 - old and tired with cramped seating for business class. Cabin crew were a bit better on this leg, though still disengaged. The food was of average quality, though the wine list, while small, was good. Overall, BA has the feel of a budget carrier compared to some of its middle eastern counterparts. The lounge is sub par, particularly when compared to the Qatar lounge in Doha, or even the Qantas / One World lounge in LAX. The business class ticket was reasonably cheap, though I can now see why.

First the flight was delayed of 2 hours and since we had to make a connection in London to go to Geneva, we only had 45 minutes do so and it was a nightmare. No one to helped us, we had to run like crazy in the airport. We had to pass security and immigration one more time, we finally made it but we were the very last ones to board the plane to Geneva as it was about to close is door. I was shocked that British Airways did not provide us with any assistance, obviously they do not care about their customers. On our way back, the flight from Geneva to London was late by more than 40 minutes, and we had to run again in order to catch our flight to Atlanta. We flew in premium economy that does not even have its own bathroom, when you are in premium economy, there is only one bathroom for about 150 people and it is a shared one with people in economy. The food is non existent, one ounce of salad and four once of a ""so-called"" meal + dessert and watery coffee. You will be left hungry, so don't rely on their food because it is more than a huge disappointment. We paid $3800 for this trip and I regret choosing this airline. Premium economy is not worth the extra fee, you only get 7 inches more than in economy but that's it. You will struggle to find a bathroom available and the food is exactly the same than in economy. That's it.  I will not fly with them again and for everyone who is interested to make a flight connection in London Heathrow, please make other arrangements as it is a huge airport and British Airways flights are late.

No passenger in window seat so I had aisle and window to myself but the arm rest between the seats only goes up half way - seems a BA design feature and is annoying.

The cabin crew were trying to serve coffee in the middle of the meal in order to disappear as fast as possible. They reappeared at breakfast, which was the BA version of a ""full English"" as it was on the outward trip - something yellow which pretended to be egg, but the rest was OK. Landed on time.

one of the worst flight/travel experiences,Mark Dixon,22/09/2016,United Arab Emirates,"  Abu Dhabi to Heathrow return. Probably one of the worst flight/travel experiences me and my family have had to endure! From what was supposed to be a joyous occasion for us as a family taking our daughter to the UK to get settled into university turned into an experience that will make sure that we never fly British Airways again. First when checking in in Abu Dhabi the flight was cancelled due to technical problems with their new Boeing 787. Of course flights get cancelled and we fully understand but what was rediculous was the total lack of communication. Passengers stood around for hours with no one knowing what was going on, eventually a check in clerk told the passengers to come back the next day at 10 am for check in. The actual flight time was 14:00, then the plane was delayed yet again. British Airways staff were no where to be found! Eventually a supposed British Airways manager arrived. We then couldn't check in because the system was broken, after an hour they decided to manually check us in and we were away to get our daughter settled in Uni.! Arriving at Heathrow, two hours to clear customs because they were short staffed. Then on to collect bags only to find that my daughters bag for Uni was missing, apparently never made the flight and no one knows where it is. Again no communication from British Airways despite several calls to them each day and the crazy thing is that you have to repeat the story to every service centre person that answers the phone. Sad thing is that in the move to Uni she had packed a few sentimental items into her check in bag, when we explained this to the BA phone operator, she was told that was probably not the wisest decision. Thank you BA for the great advice. Now sitting on the plane returning to home to Abu Dhabi (same plane) 6 days later and the plane is delayed again due to hydraulic fluid leaking from the engine. Great you found the leak! But a new plane all these problems!

cabin crew very apologetic,26 reviews,21/09/2016,United States,"  
Flew from London Heathrow to Seattle. Poor boarding procedure at T5 with the indicators suggesting flight was not ready to board but on arriving at gate we walked straight on, passing others who were waiting and seemingly not sure whether to board or not. Econ seemed about 75% full. Sat half way down but told no choice available for main meal which was served after about 3 hours of taking off. Cabin crew very apologetic and blamed management for recent cost cutting measures, saying this is happening a lot and upsetting many passengers. Travelling with 3 children who didn't like the only option offered, so much frustration with British Airways taking a budget airline approach but charging all full service price. Complained to Customer Service after arriving home and was told the caterer at LHR was to blame and they didn't want to delay the flight waiting for the extra meals. Seems a bit lame and complete contradiction to what the crew said. Crew made an extra effort to bring a few snacks from business to my children which was highly appreciated. Hard to recommend BA but given the competition on this route, and the desire to stay with One World/BA FFP, it's a poor choice.",Boeing 747,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to SEA,01/08/2016,no,Verified,1,3,4,1,1,2,4
by far the worst cabin crew,Paul Bryde,20/09/2016,Australia,"  I am a regular traveller on many airlines and a One World Emerald FF. British Airways flight BA632 from LHR to Athens on 11th September was by far the worst cabin crew that I have encountered in 45 years of flying. The crew had no interest in the interests of passengers in Business Class, and were more interested in chatting with each other in the galley area. After 1.5 hours in the air, we were offered a drink, the champagne was undrinkable, and the crew gave me a gin and tonic. After that they did a meal service and served a fish dish that had been overheated and again was inedible. That was all the service we received on the whole flight of 3.5 hours. No top up of drinks no offer of water, and again the cabin crew spent their whole time in the galley eating and talking. I even went out and asked them was there any service on this aircraft, and received no reply",Boeing 767,Solo Leisure,Business Class,LHR to ATH,01/09/2016,no,Verified,4,1,1,1,3,1,3

Boarding through gate 209 organised seat 3A old but clean and comfortable 767, departed about 1 hour late good food & service from a nice crew, arriving LHR on time although the flight arrived on to the furthest possible gate and immigration (Not BA's fault) took so long with huge queue which meant over 1 hour getting landside.

not worth paying for First Class,A Dawson ,18/09/2016,United Kingdom,"  Miami to London Heathrow with British Airways in First Class. The boarding process at Miami was chaotic with the staff member inviting World Traveller Plus, Club World and First Class to all join the queue to board. Despite flying First Class it took 15 minutes to get to the front of the queue and a further 10 minutes on the jet bridge before getting onboard. The crew were indifferent and we were not escorted to our seats. The ""hot"" towel service before take off was a cold dry towel which had not seen any hot water. The ""hot"" nuts were served 10 minutes after the drinks. The meal was dry and of poor quality. The cabin crew forgot my partners main course and put one in the oven 30 minutes after everyone else had eaten and when it was served, it was cold and inedible. When the crew member made my bed up I was informed they had ""run out"" of duvets and the crew only managed to find one after I complained about the poor experience to the CSM. Based on this experience, BA's penny pinching across all of the cabins has lowered the quality of all of the product and it is not worth paying for First Class - save yourself some money because United Airlines Economy Class is better than what I experienced on this flight.",Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,First Class,MIA to LHR,01/09/2016,no,Verified,8,1,1,1,1,1,1
BA on this route are a joke,1 reviews,18/09/2016,United Kingdom," We flew as a group of 4 from Heathrow to Krakow in Club Europe. The aircraft was clean and newish so had the new ""economy"" seats in the Club section. I would like to know who at British Airways sanctions the use of these tiny seats in Club (I know its nice to have the middle seat blocked but I would prefer a bigger seat to sit in - maybe BA should have a look at Turkish Airlines Biz cabin!) The service outbound was just adequate - one drinks round, then a dinner service (BA872) which was edible but slopping / dumping the meal out of a heated plastic container into a china dish in front of the passenger lacks some grace to say the least. Are the crew trained to do this or was it just bone idleness not to prepare the meal in the galley then serve to the passenger? In all, the outbound journey was just about passable but not comfortable given the seating. Now for the return - what a joke! Nn lounge at Krakow - that's right you squeeze onto the end of that overcrowed bench by the gate and keep quiet! The flight was delayed by nearly 3 hours, so by the time boarding started it was a scrum (priority boarding abandoned) to get through the gate as most passengers were so fed up. British Airways prefer not to pay for airbridge access to the plane so we were then treated to a nice ride in an old banger bus crammed to the gills with sweaty fed up passengers all trying to avoid other peoples armpits. Once on the plane the same tiny seats, although we were winners all round as we managed to bag 1A and 1C so at least we had some leg room. The meal service on this leg really did make me giggle. The steward offered a shriveled chicken salad (leg meat skewers), or get this, a boxed sandwich. I actually had to ask if that was it? He replied ""yes"" to which I replied ""so who's eaten all the food?"" He laughed and actually said we were lucky, and if I had any food with me could he have some! And I'm not making this up. Once at LHR it took 1h for the bags to turn up by which time the Pod service to the parking had stopped (and that turned into a complete drama but I won't go there on this ocassion). So - what did we get for our Club fare to Krakow? In my opinion very little, and what we did get was rubbish. If anyone is thinking of going to Krakow with BA my advice is save your money and fly economy (with another airline), and spend the saving having fun there. In fact choose another airline since BA on this route are just a joke. I have been Club Europe hundreds of times over the last 20 years and the gradual decline in the product has now just about reached the point where once I have used up my 300K Avios it'll be Bye Bye BA for good.

only 4 seats available to choose from,G Trenton,14/09/2016,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Larnaca. I went into the British Airways app on my phone 20 seconds after online check-in opened, and totally disappointed to see only 4 seats available to choose from. This is the second time this has happened with British Airways in the last few months, who really should not be offering an online check-in service if you not given a reasonable choice of seat selection! I called them to enquire why they do this, to which the reply was that most seats are ""restricted"" on online check-in. They did sort the seat I wanted however as I'm flying with my Mother who obviously I want to be sat next to. Yet when I looked yesterday at the option of paying £15 for a seat reservation before online check-in opens, there was a good choice available. If British Airways really want to charge extra for choosing a seat, and make it almost impossible to have a seat choice for those not paying, then they should abolish the online check-in as it's clearly not providing the service it should do - Online check-in means being able to choose from several seats, not being unacceptably limited to 4 seat choices only, just 20 seconds after online check-in has opened!",A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to LCA,01/09/2016,yes,Verified,7,3,4,1,3,3,1
look at alternatives next time,41 reviews,14/09/2016,United Kingdom,"  No online check in is available from Dubrovnik so everyone checks in at the airport. Lounge in Dubrovnik is OK but refreshments poor, but better than being in the busy main departures area. The in bound flight was late and we were therefore late departing. No priority boarding. Cabin again not very clean probably because they were trying to minimise the delay! No newspapers available, when there are only 4 rows in business you would thing BA could provide them in the premium cabin. So called 'Brunch' was served, which was a few sad looking pieces of ham and cheese with a tomato, lettuce leaf and cucumber. Very poor for what is scheduled as just under a 3 hour flight. This to me is cost cutting too far and not sure how BA expect to hold onto premium passengers who are paying a lot of money for their tickets. Cabin crew did nothing to stop economy passengers coming through to use the toilet in business, is it that difficult?

First Class is average at best,S Simpson,14/09/2016,United Kingdom,"  Took a domestic flight from Knoxville to Atlanta for onward British Airways flight to Heathrow. Went to BA to check in only to be told that they did not have my reservation so I needed to resolve it with my travel agent. Check in staff not bothered and bordered on being rude. Finally resolved the issue after about an hour with the assistance of my agent. Lounge in Atlanta was mediocre at best. Flight itself was fine and the crew were very attentive but meals weren't anything special. I'd say BA First Class is average at best when compared to Emirates or Singapore Airlines. My baggage didn't arrive at Heathrow so had to go through the rigmarole of raising a case with BA lost baggage - it was finally delivered almost a week later. Overall, not the kind of service that you would expect when flying First Class. Raised a complaint and received a response after nearly three weeks (and four follow up calls to customer relations), who said that since my agent had booked my Knoxville flight that was due to land in Atlanta less than 3.5 hours before the scheduled departure for the flight to Heathrow, their system ""automatically took my booking off"" - I don't know whether this is normal but I've never come across this issue before in all my years of flying. Absolutely awful customer service. BA have declined steadily over the years and its overall offering simply isn't good enough, not to mention their attitude towards customers paying for their premium cabins, which is atrocious.

On boarding disappointed by the cleanliness of the cabin, when lowering the tray table from the seat in front on both my seat 4C and my wife 4A, they were very dirty, nothing that could not be solved by a wet cloth, but not good enough.

very disappointed by gate agents,51 reviews,14/09/2016,Switzerland,"  London Heathrow to Hong Kong. Very disappointed by the gate agents or whoever was making decisions about seat allocation for BA 31 service to HKG on September 10th. I was buying my ticket in April, so early. As BA Executive Club Gold member I had reserved already then my favorite seat on this aircraft type, 51D on upper deck at time of buying the ticket. In AMS, when checking in for that flight, this seat was still granted, 2.5 hours later at gate I was reallocated to 14G on main deck. First no explanation, then that they ""could make a family happy to sit together"", but they could not tell me if this family was traveling with children or not. No other seat available due to a full flight. Just the cabin service director was able to get me a change to 13B, a seat a little further away from the restrooms. But still recurring disturbing odors and noisier flight on main deck. - I have gotten already 2620 EC tier points this year and have little understanding for how they treated me. I am so regularly flying with them, they know my preferences: upper deck, aisle seat and as much in front as possible. I am ready to give up my seat for families with infants or any handicapped person, but upon their reaction I guess this was not the case.  Communication is marketing and this was very bad done by BA this time! Why should I be loyal to a company which is not respecting my loyalty benefits? Especially concerning their reservation policy, that people not paying for reservation earlier on or booking late need to be aware that they might not be seated together!

in all a waste of money,K Haymes,11/09/2016,Germany,"  The many problems I had with my outbound flight paled in comparison to my return. On arrival at T3 from another carrier I went to the BA baggage check in and was told that unlike every other major carrier in a major hub airport anywhere on the planet, BA cannot possibly transfer bags to my departure terminal, T5. The agent made it clear it could be done but that she would get in trouble. Fast Track security was woefully slow and incompetent. When I arrived at the gate boarding had commenced. Though I had purchased a business upgrade to avoid some of the horrible service I had received on my outbound flight and despite having only two carry on items and despite management's false statements in their replies to my earlier complaints that ""Our hand baggage allowance at two bags with a 23kg limit for the is also one of the most generous"", despite the fact that the flight was not full and more than half of the bin space in business class was empty, I was forced to check my bag carry-on compliant bag. The flight attendants were rather shocked about this and later apologized for the gate agent's unwarranted behavior. The flight was okay with the same uncomfortable coach seats in business class and an inedible food offering. In all a waste of money for BA's ""vaulted"" business class ""experience."" The recent Economist article about BA's race to the bottom service tier and the reneged promises made along the way speaks volumes about management's hostility towards customers and especially BA and OW elites. The asterisk on the Oneworld baggage page singles out BA as the only carrier in the group who will not allow it's own elite fliers and those on OW to have a checked bag on the lowest and only competitive fare BA offers.

cabin crew was professional,25 reviews,05/09/2016,Austria,"  Vienna - London Gatwick - Porto in March 2016 in Economy, VIE-LGW 2o minutes early, LGW-OPO almost on time after a 20 minutes departure delay. Web-check did not work. After having entered all the required personal and passport details manually, the system informed me that “no web-check-in is offered for this flight”. Quite irritating, as this information could have been easily shown at the start of the procedure. Having Oneworld Sapphire status I used the manned premium check-in counter and was able to score an aisle/window seat. This worked fine with no lines but required to be at the airport earlier than intended, as BA charges extra for all seat selections (even for a middle seat at the back of the plane). Boarding for both flights was fine and hassle free. Service on the VIE-LGW leg was rather lacklustre for BA, but cabin crew was professional and the flight deck - as per usual for BA - great. Much better FA’s on the LGW-OPO leg and again flight deck excellent. Full bar service on both flights and a sandwich was served as well. BA uses a shared lounge in VIE, which is on the poor side, rather small and cramped, with limited food options. However, the hot item of the day tends to be of good quality. Snacks and drinks fall in the discount category. Lounge experience in LGW was very unsatisfactory. BA closed their own lounge at LGW to give up the space for another airline’s lounge and uses pay-per-entry No 1 Lounge, which was so crowded that even finding a place to just sit down was a challenge. Furthermore food and alcoholic drinks have to be ordered at the - slightly chaotic - bar off a menu. Food is then delivered to your seat; a time consuming process in a lounge that is filled beyond capacity. My understanding is that this arrangement will last well into 2017 before BA opens up a new lounge. Why BA gives up its own lounge space in its hub airport to accommodate another airline is beyond me. Overall solid experience in the air, but not so good on the ground. Will consider BA for further travel in Economy short haul, if fares are competitive, but will avoid departing from LGW. As for business class, I have stopped using BA a while ago due to the condensed seating arrangements on both short haul and long haul flights.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,VIE to OPO via LGW,01/03/2016,yes,Verified,5,4,4,4,2,3,-1

In any case IFE was one small screen in the bulkhead with no choice of content. Business cabin is normally rows 1 thru 9 but was extended back to row 14 meaning we had to share the two lavatories with economy section. Flight left late but arrived almost on time.

charges for baggage are outrageous,T Bowman,29/08/2016,United Kingdom,"  Lisbon to Heathrow on British Airways. I booked my ticket with a reputable travel agency and yet when I went to check-in online the BA website said I had been sold a seat-only flight. The travel agency disagreed and showed me they had booked a seat with a baggage allowance. I called BA and was messed around by their staff member. I had to pay an outrageous fee to have 1 bag of only 12 kg fly in the hold with me to London. At Lisbon airport things were hectic as the previous day their security people had been on strike. The departure board did not show the check-in area for the BA flights. I had to find my own way to where BA check-in. I joined a queue and was outraged when one of the check-in staff allowed a woman with 3 kids to queue jump. When other people objected including other families in the long queue with children the check-in agent did nothing and allowed the woman to get away with not queuing. The check-in lady I dealt with was very pleasant and cheerful. The departure from Lisbon was exceptionally busy with not one empty seat. The cabin crew were very professional. The departure was on time and during the flight a snack and drink was served. My seat was very comfortable and the drop-down screens showed the route followed. Arrival was 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Baggage on this flight is an issue in my opinion as too many passengers were allowed to bring on to the flight quite sizeable bags. When things go well, BA is excellent. However, charges for baggage are outrageous and place BA in the same category as budget airlines.

doesn't cut the mustard any longer,K Simpson,26/08/2016,United Kingdom,"  
I have to be upfront and say the flight from London Heathrow to Boston exceeded expectations mainly due to the cabin crew. Over the years British Airways first has gone so far downhill I'm afraid it just can't compete anymore, it needn't be so as the issues as I see them are all resolvable. However, the return leg was like flying with Ryanair. There were only 13 people in the cabin. There were no slippers, 2 of the menu items I requested were, in the words of the crew ""invisible"", and what did arrive was verging on inedible due to sauce being lumpy and near to warm. The chocolate lava cake contained no lava and quite how one can burn and cool food at the same time is beyond me. My father waited the entire flight, having asked on 3 seperate occasions, for a headset convertor. We were not asked if we wanted to be woken for breakfast, which I then missed assuming I would be woken. There was a palpable tension between the crew, which was confirmed on leaving the flight when we overheard a member of the crew comment he was happier to get away from the crew than the passengers. Once we had disembarked the aircraft, it was a further 25 minutes before we could get in to the airport as a door had not been unlocked. Finally, we collect our suitcases, which I have to say were present when we arrived at baggage reclaim, only to find 2 of the 4 had broken wheels. BA have subsequently supplied 2 new replacement suitcases. When comparing the service / food to Virgin UC for USA and Etihad First for east bound, BA just doesn't cut the mustard any longer I'm afraid. Such as shame as the seats / bed are great, but why pay the extra £ for service and food that just isn't forthcoming or varies from flight to flight?",Boeing 747-400,Family Leisure,First Class,"LHR to BOS, SEA to LHR",01/07/2016,no,Verified,7,5,2,1,5,1,3

After purchasing ticket I could not preselect seat assignment despite having one world sapphire status. I called BA 3 times. The first 2 times the agents stated they would select my seat for me and later the assignments dropped out of the system. After the third call the agent emailed me and explained that due to my fare category and despite my status no preselection could be made. At check-in I spent more than 45 minutes online trying to pay the junk-fee for a single piece of luggage. Again I had to call BA 3 times to get a bag checked onto my flight. 2 of the calls were to undo the mistake that the first agent made by applying the junk-fee for luggage to my return flight instead of the outbound. The second call was to get a refund and rebook the junk-fee. The third call was to complain about spending 2-hours checking in and correcting BA's mistakes. I spoke with a supervisor and offered to comp my luggage but no one ever bothered to credit the junk fee. The BA lounge at TXL is small and does not have a toilet. There were no warm food items on offer. I did find the service to be good. Boarding commenced at the farthest point at Berlin Tegel from the BA Lounge. Flight was okay with minimal amenities.

Boarding in Warsaw is chaotic. No priority boarding rules enforced (basically boarding started for everone at the same time, no matter you fly premium or are a frequent flyer). New BA short haul seats are  not really comfortable (fine for 1h flight but get uncomfortable for any longer). Same concerns meals provided. Crisps and drinks with no possibility of buying further food is not enough for 2.5h flight. I would rather cut on free alcohol and have a decent sandwich or a possiblity to buy further food if necessary. On the plus side, cabin service very well trained and attentive.

experience has really declined,G Mantimo,23/08/2016,Canada,"  The British Airways experience has really declined over the past 5 years. I often fly business class and at least premium economy. The Boeing 787 is awesome. Clean, spacious and excellent technology/media options. However the staff and service has declined. Rarely do the staff seem interested in their jobs - they are on automatic pilot. We travel with 3 children and the stroller has become a real problem. Firstly they gave a 5 kg maximum on weight. Try getting a 5 kg stroller that works in Canadian weather! So we bought a new Light stroller - however we have noticed extreme wait times to have the stroller brought to the gate after a flight ends. Try travelling with a 2-3 year old through the chaos of terminal 5 in the summer months without a stroller. With a tight 1 hour lay over we waited over 25 minutes for our stroller- the only reason we got it (ground staff forgot) was because the older and very caring pilot went down the stairs himself to get it! The younger staff could care less and left us and 2 other families alone waiting. They could learn a lot from the pilot. Also every single flight on our journey ended up leaving 1-4 hours late (a mixed blessing we made our layover because of it!). The good in the lounge and on board has suffered as well. Anyway, they have to improve.

I arrived at the airport within the permitted check-in times and was held up by a longer than anticipated queue. I went to a check-in bag drop counter where the staff ignored me for a good few minutes as she conducted a personal conversation with one of her colleagues. I was asked to place my bag onto the conveyor belt and issued a boarding pass and baggage receipt. The woman behind the counter then took the boarding pass back and after a few moments I asked her if there was a problem. She nodded and said her computer system would not let me board as my bag had been offloaded even though the bag was still on the conveyor belt and she had issued me with a boarding pass. After 15 mins she told me to take my bag and go to a different area for help. It was bizarre. I joined a second queue where a very helpful man explained that the first person I dealt with had not checked me correctly due to timings. He made a telephone call and as my flight was delayed by almost one hour he told me not to worry and to make my way to through security to the gate. Boarding was not efficient. One would expect better from BA. The queue was poorly managed. The cabin crew with one exception were frosty and functional. One cabin crew member, an older lady was superb and I saw her help a young mum with a baby and answering questions from 2 Japanese people with limited English. This member of the cabin crew was a superb representative of her airline. My seat was not clean and there were crumbs on the floor. The captain made very clear announcements and there was a nice drop-down screen to show the route of the flight. A cup of tea and a small packet of crisps were offered.  My bag did not arrive into Dublin with me and so I had to join a queue for Swissport. This is where my nightmare started. A uniformed woman who said she represented BA told me my bag would “most likely” not arrive until tomorrow. I asked her if the bag would be on the next flight and she said no and suggested that I leave the airport and that a courier would deliver the bag to where I was staying. I took her advice only to receive an automated email that same evening to inform me that my bag had indeed been placed on the next flight. Over the next few days a nightmare began. I spent many hours calling Swissport and their courier DPD. To be fair the DPD staff were helpful and told me the reference number from Swissport was wrong. Swissport insisted the reference number was correct.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to DUB,01/08/2016,no,Verified,6,3,2,2,1,2,-1
friendly and professional,B Richardson,14/08/2016,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow - Vancouver - London Heathrow. First impressions could have been better as this flight departs from Terminal 3, rather than terminal 5 at Heathrow. The departure lounge was being used by multiple longhaul flights on large aircraft meaning that the area as crammed full with most passengers having to stand and making it difficult to access the departure gates. However the ground staff did their best to manage the situation and were clearly used to having to manage it. Once on board I found the cabin to be very clean. Unlike many airlines, BA offers economy seating upstairs on the A380 where the ride is noticably smoother and quieter than on most other aircraft. However the profile of the cabin means that the overhead lockers are smaller than usual, which could be an issue for those with roller cases. The IFE system provided is excellent. I also ordered one of BA's new gourmet meal offerings rather than take the standard meal. This option was well worth taking up, offering an improved choice and quality. The service provided by the flight attendants was friendly and professional and this is one area where British Airways seems to do consistently well. If I have a criticism it is that the 31 inch seat pitch seems miserly for a 9-10 hour flight. Arrival at Vancouver was on time and I was through immigration and landside in about 20 minutes. Processing through security for departure from YVR was equally efficient. The return flight offered a similar experience to the outward one, although arrival in London was an hour late. However the relatively quiet cabin on the A380 meant that I was able to get some sleep. Unfortunately the arrival experience at LHR terminal 3 was no better than the departure one. A lengthy walk to arrivals concluded with having to join a slow-moving, snaking line to clear immigration. A marked contrast to the experience at YVR.",A380,Business,Economy Class,LHR to YVR,01/08/2016,yes,Verified,1,3,5,5,3,3,5
A380 is unconscionably crammed,W Jackson,14/08/2016,United States,"  Flew London Heathrow to Washington DC. The Business Class Cabin on a British Airways A380 is unconscionably crammed with seven seats per row. Most other international carriers I've flown limit themselves to no more than four, or, at most, five seats per row in Business Class. In the BA configuration, passengers in the middle of each row are trapped in their seats if their seatmate choses to extend their seat into a flatbed. Also, the seats lack any storage space save a tiny drawer suitable for no more than a pair of shoes, and the seats are claustrophobically narrow.

The entertainment screen options were much more extensive than I've had before so I'm not sure if the different route made a difference or a different plane. The crew were kind and unobtrusive.

superb service was provided,Chris Martin,13/08/2016,United Kingdom," Flew London Gatwick to Tampa. BA Club World (Business Class) is a great way to travel. Unfortunately due to renovations at LGW, British Airways are having to utilise a lounge so it wasn't as restful as may otherwise have been but once complete I'm sure that standard will be resumed. On boarding it was nice to be ""welcomed back"", a small but nice touch. Straight after settling into our seats came complimentary drinks, warm towels and our menu choices. BA does a great filet steak and the desserts were fantastic. One of the things I really love about BA is the fact that they have a diverse age range when it comes to their cabin crew. The more ""senior members"" really do know their stuff - the things that only experience gives you and this flight was no exception. Superb service was provided by the cabin crew and even when stretching my legs they were quick to offer refreshments and guide me to the galley where a large selection of snacks/ drinks are available between the regular drink/meal service. The only downsides for me are the seating arrangement that means that those in window or centre seats have to step over other passengers when those passengers are fully reclined and the IFE which really does need an update. I know that the second point is being addressed on the older aircraft. As an aviation enthusiast, a really big thing for me is that the flight deck crew are always ready to spend some time chatting after the flight. BA!

very satisfied with flight and service,16 reviews,03/08/2016,Singapore,"  Singapore to Sydney return on a British Airways fifth freedom route. Boarding for the outgoing flight (BA15) from Singapore was a bit disorganised and there was congestion on the aerobridge. On board the aircraft had an air-conditioning problem so the cabin was quite warm. Seats were fairly comfortable with a fairly narrow seat pitch, and the entertainment selection was fairly good. Bar service commenced 30 minutes after departure. The chicken main meal was pretty good but would have preferred dinner to be served 1 hour and not 2 hours into the flight. Prior to arrival I received a snack box which contained a really bad sandwich, granola bar and some yoghurt. Cabin crew didn't offer a regular drinks service on this flight. Return flight to Singapore (BA16) was a notch better - boarding in Sydney was done in a more efficient manner. Bar and main meal service was quicker, although evidence of BA's cost cutting can be seen as they've now removed cheese and crackers from the main meal. Cabin crew did do two rounds of drinks service on this flight and were more attentive. Good sandwich for the snack/dinner service before arrival. Late departures on both flights but arrivals into Sydney and Singapore were on time. Still good to note they provide toothbrushes even during day flights. Very satisfied with this BA flight and service, especially when their full service competitors charge around 40% more on Sydney flights and budget challengers aren't up to the mark with the price and service.",Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SIN to SYD,01/08/2016,yes,Verified,7,4,4,4,4,5,4

provided reasonable cabin service,E Smyth,01/08/2016,United Kingdom,  Miami to London Heathrow with British Airways. Busy check in at MIA. This being explained by broken windscreen on flight BA206 which led to their passengers being rebooked. Our own flight BA208 was befallen by a damaged tyre which took 3 hours to fix. The Admiral lounge at MIA was reasonable. The flight left late and staff provided reasonable cabin service. Toilets constantly used by economy class passengers which left them less clean than usual and less readily available. Slept well on flat bed. Breakfast was OK. They had to manage 300 missed transfers as a result of the delayed arrival and the staff seemed well prepared for this. Baggage damaged (one item) and lost (two items). I watched the ground crew at MIA unload the A380 from the gate after it arrived and I can state that in some cases they literally flung the cases onto the ground from the hold.

In addition to Chamonix we have homes in London and Telluride, Colorado and BA lost us as customers for quite a few years on the LHR to DEN, 777 service, again because of the ridiculous seat forward/backward seat configuration in Business Class, that requires us or someone else to climb over us to get out of the seat during the flight. Therefore we flew Air NZ (much, much better flight if a little inconvenient) to LAX (6-8 return flights a year) and suffered longer on United to get to our destination as BA Business was so bad. Fortunately they now have a 747 on the LHR to DEN service where we can fly First Class which we are using, but it would only take another airline to do this route for us to move away from the ageing cabin staff and extremely average service.",A320,Business,Business Class,LHR to GVA,01/07/2016,no,Verified,8,1,2,1,1,1,-1

Boarding wasn't done by priority, just a free for all at the gate - fine but nothing special. My real issue is with the offering on-board: no special seats, just the middle seat of three left free. We were then served a 'meal' of a few lettuce leaves, two tomatoes, two bits of cheese and a piece of chicken - really BA?

The boarding was a very far gate in the Satelite area of T3 and at around the same time we boarding to Vancouver a 747 was boarding to Las Vegas. So the area was very congested, the announcements of boarding were barely audible. The outward bound flight was uneventful (great) and as smooth a trip as I've ever had. Inbound was similar with just the annoyance of waiting for a stand at LHR for 40 minutes which spoilt a little the ending. The crew both ways were superb and professional.

We upgraded from Economy to Premium Economy at the airport for $382 each. We had tried to upgrade ahead of time with our frequent flyer points but could not because we booked through Costco (Costco said we needed to go thru BA and BA said we had to go thru Costco). Boarding was not well organized. Our flight from London was delayed and we had a difficult time finding out where to go as the airport departures board did not list a gate and departure time kept changing. One BA associate told us it would probably leave from gate 18 which proved to be incorrect information. We finally asked an attendant at a random gate who looked it up on her iPad. We had to sprint back to gate 1 with 15 minutes until departure. When we arrived at that gate, we were told we would be bussed to our gate. We waited another 25 minutes for buses. Seats were fairly comfortable. Food was just okay - the small steak served was over cooked and as hard as rock. We arrived in Rome almost 2 hours late. Coming home we traveled economy as we decided the charge to upgrade on the way there was not a good value. Our flight from Rome to London was late in arriving which made us almost an hour late taking off from Rome. Boarding was chaotic and you couldn't understand the announcements being made about who was to board and when. Other people were turned back rather rudely by BA staff. Everyone seemed confused. Snack on board was small but tasty. We had to be ""express serviced"" through security in London in order to catch our connecting flight. No time to catch a snack or use the toilet. Boarding was in-process when we arrived at the gate. Then we sat on the tarmac for an hour before we could take off. Seats were very narrow and close together to the point that when the person in front of you reclined their seat, the back of the seat was very close to your face. You had to ""go horizontal""in order to get in and out of the seat to use the rest room. Arm rests between seats and at the end of the row did not lift up entirely so you had to slide over the arm rests. Food was pretty good. On board entertainment was good. Service was slow, forcing you to sit for an extended length of time with a tray squeezed in front of you. Our luggage is on an extended vacation as it did not make it to our flight in London. We arrived 25 minutes late to LAX.

When we checked in at JNB, we were told we could not check our luggage through to EDI because the two sectors were on different (but still BA) tickets.

seat was really comfortable,1 reviews,19/06/2016,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to Newark return. Having just returned from my holiday, flying with British Airways in their World Traveller Plus class, I thought I would post my review. The week before we flew, we paid the £48 per person to select our seats so I had the comfort of knowing we would be sat together. We flew out of T5 at LHR one what I think is one of BA’s new 787 to Newark at 10.35am, and plane interior looked new and clean. We took our seats 21 J and K which were right next to the toilets. On our seats we found a small pillow, blanket, headphones and an amenity kit. I had plenty of leg room (ok, I am 5’5) and my partner had the entertainment box impacting his leg room but he seemed to be ok with it (he is 5’10). Although our seats were next to the toilets, we didn’t get disturbed movement or smells. Once the curtain was pulled between us and World Traveller, you wouldn’t have known we were by the bathrooms. We were offered a glass of something fizzy – water and juice were also available. Hot towels were handed out. Menus were handed out and main course was a choice of beef or chicken, with a pasta salad to start and a strawberry cheesecake for dessert, with cheese and biscuits. The food was ok, it was hot and tasted good. The food service was quick, and prior to the food served, drinks were handed out including a drink for the meal. However, during food service another drink was also offered. So, three small bottles of wine for the flight and I was well on my way to relaxing and starting my holiday. As we didn’t have anyone behind us, we could recline our seats without worrying about disturbing anyone. As there was a wall behind us, we couldn’t recline as far back as others, but it was comfortable enough. Luckily for both of us, the people in front of us didn’t really recline theirs too far. The seat was really comfortable, and even with my generous back side, I felt I had plenty of room. Although I had loaded up my tablet with films and books, I didn’t use it at all. Neither did I use the vast choice of IFE – I used to 6.5hour flight time to have some “me” time. My partner found plenty of choice and enough to watch during the flight. After food, the mood lighting was switched on and stayed that way until we were an hour from landing. Most people (me included) took the opportunity to have a bit of shut eye. A sandwich and small chocolate bar, tea and coffee was served and after a quick freshen up (in my seat). The pilot announced we would be landing and that the toilets would only be available for another 20 minutes or so. I quickly brushed my teeth to freshen up, but what was annoying was the number of people who decided to have almost a full make over in the toilets, spending 10 or more minutes in there – whilst the queue of people waiting to use the facilities grew longer. However, the toilets were clean. The landing was smooth and we arrived on time – I suppose you would say we were 20 minutes early, but don’t the airlines have that little trick of appearing to land early? On leaving the plane I did have a look at Business Class, and without offending regular Business Class users, I did wonder exactly what you get for your money.

Snack and drinks provided; quite adequate for this short flight. Seats reasonably comforatable and more legroom than most budget airlines. Now that BA prices are competitive with many budget airlines this additional leg room becomes important. Flight arrived a few minutes late at OPO but some of the lost time was made up during the flight.

passing off economy seats as business,Y Wong,18/06/2016,United Kingdom,"  We travelled on BA 633 from Athens on 12th of June, 2016. The flight departed at 7.55 pm but sat on the tarmac for 30 mins due to bad weather at London. Nonetheless, we only got in 15 minutes late. What went wrong from the very beginning was the check in process. We had showed up early but was refused check in at Club Europe. The ground attendant at Athens was incredibly rude and abrupt. If they had explained it to us nicely, we would have been fine with it. The result of the two hour before flight check in resulted in chaos and long lines given the fact that it was a 767 – a larger than usual plane. When we finally lined up, it took a good 30 minutes and more to check in at Club Europe because for half that time, there was only one counter open. Eventually, a second counter opened but a young couple jumped the queue by using the excuse that she was pregnant (unheard of policy and she was perfectly healthy given how fast she rushed up) and that was allowed by the ground atttendants despite the long line-up. Eventually we got to the plane only to find a ridiculous two tier Business class system that stretched into the economy section without any separation of any kind. Seating became problematic as those assigned to the windows on each side had smaller spaces, and in fact were no more bigger than the economy class. The middle seats were fine as passengers there had the empty middle seat. British Airways were passing off economy seats as business but though the service was different – you couldn’t properly enjoy it. We were placed on the last row of Business class (14) and these were three seats stretching into the economy class cabin. It was so confusing that the crew tried to serve economy class food to our end. To be fair, I think other business class passengers had it more unfortunate in their seat assignments. Furthermore, when asked for a blanket, I was refused one on the basis there was none until I walked into the upper cabin and found that business class passengers there had blankets. How is this fair? What principle of seat assignment did they use? The last few BA trips to Europe have been nightmarish, from boarding processes (this one in Athens was chaotic and unsystematic, they had allowed everyone to rush forward thus blocking the pre-boarding process). We were assigned different seats far from each other and not according to our preferences in our Exec Club, the online check-in keeps breaking down and when we tell BA that, they tell us to call in (laugh out hysterically here). In fact the more frequent you are a flyer (but not high profile), the worse treatment you get. I also get a sense that communication between the crew is poor given that different services were offered (later on, the Cabin director told me she could find a blanket for me but we were already 30 mins from landing). I cannot blame the crew, they work with what they get.  If we knew we were going to be treated no better than economy, we would have booked economy.",Boeing 767,Couple Leisure,Business Class,ATH to LHR,01/06/2016,no,Verified,1,1,4,2,1,2,-1
staff friendly but professional,2 reviews,17/06/2016,United Kingdom, New York JFK to London Gatwick with British Airways. Excellent flight. Left more or less on time and even with the interminable taxing at JFK we still arrived on time at London Gatwick. Flight was very busy but the service didn't suffer. Staff were friendly but professional and the B777 was clean and in excellent condition. Couldn't ask for more. This was my return flight but the outward flight was just as good. Credit to British Airways - there was a woman near me who was terriifed of flying and one of the flight attendants sat with her through the landing. Poor woman was sick due to a bit of turbulence just before landing but the attendant dealt with it pefectly. I only booked a week before I flew and the price was very good.

flight was late and chaotic,N Ashton,16/06/2016,United Kingdom,"  For those who have alluded to there being ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" on BA flights in terms of customer service I can assure them this is not the case. I am a gold executive club member and can confirm that I have invariably been treated with equal levels of contempt as a customer at all levels of their executive and club and most cabins. My last experience was with my wife flying from London Gatwick to Faro on the 18 May 2016. Checked in at the first counter for our economy flight to be told by the apparently gleeful BA employee that the plane was rammed so we knew we would be in for an uncomfortable flight. The lounges that are available whilst the BA lounges are renovated were packed and filthy. The BA lounge greeter offered no apology when we couldn’t access the clubrooms that were full. The flight was late and chaotic. A group of loud boisterous men, were virtually running the economy cabin, roaming the cabin whilst the seatbelt signs were on and raiding the galley to return with clutches of mini wines and spirits. This resulted in my Wife being told they had run out of gin and tonic. It turned out to be a lie when the Purser emerged from club to serve one of the other passengers with a G&T on a tray. Returned home 10 days later and complained. Received a jumbled response. Cancelled all non essential flights with them in the future including high yield club world flights and will only use them when forced - they didn’t seem to care so good luck to them.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LGW to FAO,01/05/2016,no,Verified,2,1,1,1,1,3,-1

cabin crew were excellent,Mark Dobson,14/06/2016,United Kingdom,"  Very good flight back to London from Barbados. Bridgetown, Barbados is a small airport but the ground staff are very friendly and efficient and the Exec lounge is good with reasonable snacks given the time of day (mid-late afternoon) and a decent selection of drinks available. Aircraft was clean and it looked as if the Club World cabin had recently received some tlc. Entertainment system was excellent with a good choice of movies and very clear screen, no doubt part of the overall attention the cabin seemed to have been given. Bar service was good and the food was tasty, good portion sizes, the cheesecake for dessert was 'almost' too much. Being a night flight the crew got the bar and food service completed early in the flight allowing passengers to get some sleep before the lights came back up for breakfast. Breakfast was good. Cabin crew were excellent, friendly and efficient. Cockpit crew were clear and concise with their comms at the start and end of the trip.

attention to detail is lacking,K Richards,11/06/2016,Australia,"  On the 17th May I reviewed British Airways 777-200 flight from Bangkok to London which was not great with a 3/10 score given. After changing the return flight we opted to travel A380 to Singapore. Very pleased to say that overall the experience was excellent, the Premium Economy product on this aircraft is fantastic. Seat pitch, entertainment unit, overall comfort was good. The food was ok but I think attention to detail is lacking to polish off this product. 1st meal you receive has metal cutlery yet the second meal is plastic. Only a minor negative.

food was just appalling,Harold Bush-Howard,11/06/2016,United Kingdom,"  I would have been very disappointed indeed if I had paid a full fare for my business class ticket. The food was just appalling. I could hardly get two mouthfuls our of my starter and the main course (beef) was hard, tasteless and very small. Compared to business class meals in say Cathay Pacific or Qatar Airways, portions on both starter and main were around 50% less. Incredibly, British Airways serve such mean meals in business class on a transatlantic route, where they make most of their money, I was hungry after the meal so later on decided to 'raid the larder' but they only had sweet, which I generally avoid. The menu states there would be yoghurt and other stuff there they were not available. The FAs were embarrassed and got me some cheese. Plus were excellent service, good selection of IFE and comfortable enough seats (a larger pillow would do), although I hate having to climb over someone to get out of my seat.

further delay was likely,Ian Robinson,06/06/2016,United Kingdom,"  We arrived at Gatwick just after 07.30 to catch the 10.00 flight to St Lucia. Check in was fine and although security was tight, we were airside just after 08.00. Before having breakfast we checked the flight information screen which indicated that the departure gate would be available at 09.00. After tea and toast we checked at 09.00 and the board indicated that the departure information would now be available 10.00. Obviously this was the first time that alarm bells start ringing as it was plain to see that we were going to be delayed. The on screen information then changed again to say that the departure details would be available at 11.00. At this point I did venture down to the British Airways information desk but as there was a queue of around fifteen people, I gave up and sat down again. At 12.00 the screen info finally said that we had a new departure time of 14.00. During all of this time I should add that at no time was any information (other than the screen) made available to passengers regarding the flight or details of refreshments etc. Despite numerous announcements from Easyjet and other airlines BA was conspicuous by its silence. We were eventually notified of the gate number and for the first time we were told as we entered the departure area the reason for the delay. Apparently there had been a problem with the cargo door and they had decided it needed to be replaced. Despite the rather cramped departure area, everyone seemed ready to board until we were told that the repairs were not complete and there would be a further delay and if some passengers wanted to stretch their legs they could leave their boarding passes with the ground staff and leave the departure area. Eventually we boarded just after 14.30. When everyone was settled in their seats the pilot apologised again and said the repairs still hadn't been completed and a further delay was likely. We eventually departed just after 15.30 after a delay of over five and a half hours. Now I know 'stuff' happens but let's not forget that we were departing from one of BA's home airports and why they couldn't have a second plane available quicker than five and a half hours is anybody's guess. Various people writing on online forums have previously spoken about the holiday routes from Gatwick being dumbed down by BA in favour of the traditional business routes flying out of Heathrow. I have no idea whether this is true or not but I would ask one question, if this flight had been a morning flight from Heathrow to JFK, would BA have found a solution quicker? Once in the air, the flight was fine, nothing special but nothing bad and would have been acceptable without the delay.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,LGW to UVF,01/05/2016,no,Verified,1,4,3,3,1,3,2

BA falls down on presentation,C Neal,30/05/2016,United Kingdom,"  
Going against the grain somewhat I have to say that I truly prefer flying with British Airways over Emirates on the London Heathrow - Dubai route. Having tried both airlines several times I am definitely going to side with BA on this one. Firstly, BA offer some really competitive prices on this route. If you happen to have a few Avios tucked away then this flight can be a real steal. Secondly, out of LHR, BA really does have the best terminal. Okay, so Terminal 3 for Emirates isn't the worst terminal in the world but I much prefer Terminal 5. Spacious, light and with good dining options. As for the aircraft, well it's a choice between choosing the passenger pleaser that is the A380 or the retro classic that is the B747. I'll happily fly in either, although even after the refit the 747 is still showing it's age. As an economy passenger I have found the product on British Airways to be perfectly reasonable. The seat pitch is average, seat comfort is average, IFE screen size again is average. You get a choice of the latest blockbusters and a few other options. With Emirates you have a huge IFE, thousands of films to choose from and slightly better seat width and pitch. However, I've also wondered what the appeal is of choosing from thousands of films that I have no interest in watching. I'd rather just take my iPad preloaded with films I actually want to watch. The lack of WiFi isn't a huge concern for me. Hopefully the GoGo 2KU product BA is installing from 2017 will be more robust. Now for the catering. As an economy passenger I'm not expecting much but on the last few flights with BA I have been pleasantly surprised. The food has not only been edible but also really quite tasty. Where BA falls down is on presentation which is quite frankly awful. It's also the little extras that I notice. A pre-dinner drinks service. Coffee and tea offered throughout the cabin. Real cheese and crackers to finish off the meal (As opposed to soft cheese - I'm not 5 years old). With BA you also get a more substantial snack prior to landing. It's just a little tuck box but it is far more generous than the Emirates economy offering. I've found the crew to be hit and miss, in fairness, I've found that treating crew in the same friendly and warm manner as you expect to be treated normally brings out the best in them. The recent newspaper deal with the Murdoch empire is a nice touch. Along with the Daily Hate and 'i' newspapers to choose from you also get The Times, The Sun and Financial Times as complimentary options. Arrivals for BA at DXB is a bit of a nightmare. Terminal 1 immigration is something else and the journey from runway to stand can be epic. However, the new concourse D for departures is really nice. Not too blingy. Overall, a pleasant flight. I would happily fly with BA again.",Boeing 747-400,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to DXB,01/05/2016,yes,Verified,7,3,4,4,4,4,3
a thoroughly pleasant flight,Andy Magowan,27/05/2016,United Kingdom,"  This was a flight from Gatwick to Bermuda on a 777 with British Airways. The aircraft was clean and reasonably comfortable, and the cabin crew were friendly and attentive. I am 6ft tall and normally have problems with the leg room offered in economy (Aer Lingus, I'm talking about you) but there was ample leg room. Indeed on walking through premium economy and club world on exiting the aircraft I didn't notice a big difference in leg room. I haven't flown BA for quite some years and had vague memories of the inflight meals being particularly shoddy. Not this time though. My meal was reasonably nice (chicken korma) and my fiancée had no complaints either with her pasta dish. The crew were round regularly with complementary soft drinks as well as snacks and glasses of water or pure orange. The IFE had a good selection, though one gripe is the positioning of the controls. There is a small controller built in to the top of the arm rest. This controller controls the IFE as well as your reading light and call button. More than once I accidentally pressed the light and the call button with my elbow while shifting position. A small gripe but it was quite annoying. Another gripe is the adverts you have to sit through when starting to watch a new selection. I was on continental and Virgin a couple of years ago and don't believe I had to sit through adverts before watching a movie or tv programme.

exception is British Airways,Leo Walters,24/05/2016,United States,"  Every airline which offers Business Class Travel will assign seats when booking the flight. The exception is British Airways. In January, 2016 I booked a flight for two passengers on BA in Business Class from San Francisco to London and back for travel in May/June. Seats in Business Class are not assigned until 48 hours before flight time. However, and here comes another BA first: If you want to choose your seats before that time you can do so by paying an extra fee. I ended up shelling out $484 - for the privilege of selecting two seats for the return flight. This on top of the steep fare charged for travel in Business Class. I don’t begrudge the airlines for their extra profits when the price of fuel takes a massive drop but when an airline then also engages in tactics as described in order to further maximize profitability, I rebel.",A380,Business,Business Class,SFO to LHR,01/05/2016,no,Verified,8,4,3,3,4,2,4

When I conducted online check-in I was informed that the flight will be one hour late. I proceed to JFK and at check in they kindly moved me to an earlier flight (BA172). Check in was easy and smooth. Terminal 7 at JFK is nothing exciting. Very limited shopping/dining and not enough seating. It feels like a LCC terminal. I was greeted by friendly crew once onboard. The hardware again is very dated - tiny screen, old seat and interior. Legroom was decent though, and because the flight is empty I had plenty of space to stretch out. The flight left JFK with a minor delay. As it's a light flight most passengers were sleeping. Service was done in a very discreet way. The food quality is nothing to write home about. Overall it's a typical BA flight. Very efficient and friendly crew with a very dated and unattractive product. We arrived at Heathrow early despite the late departure in JFK.

let down by inferior product,20 reviews,19/05/2016,United Kingdom,"  British Airways from London Heathrow to New York JFK on a Boeing 747 which hasn't been refitted. Checked in at Heathrow T5 was smooth and quick. T5 is pleasant enough. Used the BA Galleries lounge in T5A (South). It was busy with very limited food choice during breakfast, although the wine selection was decent. The lounge lacks atmosphere and is very basic in my opinion. The flight left Heathrow late as usual but the captain assured us that we would make up the time and should arrive early. The hardware of this particular flight is sub standard. Very old interior, worn carpet, dated toilet, and a small screen with poor resolution. Entertainment provided was very limited and not as what's being advertised on the website. Amenity pack provided is also very basic. In a way I felt I was on Premium Economy of some Asian airlines. However the seat itself was ok as it has plenty of leg room and is comfortable, although I am not a big fan of the ying-yang design. The service onboard was  very friendly and informal. A full service after take off and an afternoon tea before landing. I felt that service has been consistent and is the biggest asset of the airline.

The only outstanding experience on the flight was the service from the crew but that's where it stops. The seat was old, the footrest would not operate correctly. As a Oneworld Gold Frequent Flyer was able to get 1st row in Premium Economy. (2x2 by window). The pop up screen from the armrest would not stay in one position, the screen was cloudy and scratched making it impossible to watch the inflight entertainment so after an hour was put away. 12 hrs with no entertainment is a very long time.

Mid flight snack ok. Light Meal prior to landing was inedible, a lasagna that just the look of it put me off. Hence left behind. 12hrs 30min flight the catering is very average.

Overall experience in this flight was no any better than economy class - it's a complete joke they call this product ""business class"" - you just waste your money.",A319,Business,Business Class,OSL to LHR,01/04/2016,no,Verified,1,1,2,1,1,1,1
very pleasantly surprised,1 reviews,29/04/2016,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow to San Francisco. I've reviewed British Airways poorly in the past but was very pleasantly surprised with this flight. I have only compliments. Even with a full plane, check in was fine and well organised boarding, plus the flight was on time. The food was very good (really!), except the tateless cardboard wrap just before landing, and there were multiple drinks runs thoughout the flight. An adequate if small movie selection, service with a smile. Best economy class flight I've had for years. It's great to see that BA can still do it very well and provide such an experience. I'm even looking forward now to my return flight (and I've not been able to say that for a long time).",Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to SFO,01/04/2016,yes,Verified,3,3,4,4,4,4,3
flight was excellent,Seb Kupers,27/04/2016,Belgium,"  Chicago to Amsterdam via London Club World / Club Europe. After a very nice first flight from Tampa to Chicago with my wife and our 15 months old baby, transit in Chicago was really smooth. Our stroller was delivered at the gate and with a stroller there was a special bus to transfer us to the other terminal. We did not have to pass security a second time, so we arrived very soon in a crowded business lounge. As a gold member I checked the First lounge, but ground staff did not welcome me because it was crowded too. We found a quiet ""dinner part"" of the business lounge, were seated by a very nice ground staff who offered me a glass of champagne to relax. Food was decent. Boarding the upper deck of this Boeing 747-400 was a pleasure with a CSD welcoming us by name. Flight was excellent: food amazing, enough cold drinks were offered, cabin crew looking after us and our baby. Our baby was playing all the time, singing and talking his own words. After this perfect flight, transit in LHR terminal was again relaxing. Stroller was again waiting for us at the gate, very nice. After security we went to the first lounge which was really was crowded, but we found a quiet place to sit. Time for a shower, breakfast and relax. Last flight to Amsterdam was in a full cabin, nice and frriendly cabin crew. The only small remark we can find, is that this last flight there was no stroller waiting for us, but it arrived with our luggage.",Boeing 747-400 / A320,Family Leisure,Business Class,ORD to AMS via LHR,01/04/2016,yes,Verified,1,5,5,5,4,5,5
days of glory are long gone,E Larries,26/04/2016,United Kingdom,"  Travelled British Airways from Manchester to Dubai return via Heathrow with family. The outbound flight was a night service and dinner was served at 1am. The children didn’t eat as they were fast asleep but the food was nothing special – supermarket ready meal standard. Leg room was horrific and it truly felt like cattle class. On the return flight the seats were worn and old, screens were old and scratched the children weren’t given their choice of meals as they had run out, my three year old was given snack a box containing nuts my husband sitting next to her was asleep I was in the row behind and quickly took it away as she’s allergic. I could go on but you get the picture. The man sat next to me didn’t get any food on a 7hr plus flight – he was vegetarian and they had run out of pasta.

most exhausting trip,Sohrab Rafie,21/04/2016,Belgium,"  Amsterdam to Hong Kong via London with British Airways turned out to be one of the most exhausting trips I have made.

experience was fantastic,Alastair Birkett,21/04/2016,United Kingdom,"  Flew London Heathrow to Hong Kong. The British Airways First Class experience was fantastic. The cabin crew could not do enough to make my flight one I will not forget. The BA experience started at check in and continued right until the moment I stepped off the plane in Hong Kong. The staff all certainly demonstrated their commitment to the BA slogan ""To fly to Serve"". I chose the first course tasting menu (exclusive to the A380). Each course came with a paired wine. Each course was tasty and well presented. The crew took the time to describe each course as it was being served and continually topped up the wine. All food and beverages served were of a very high standard and quality. The seat was roomy and very comfortable. The fully flat bed was comfortable, mattress topper, cotton sheets, duvet and pillows. I am over 6 feet tall and had lots of space in my suite for sleeping. I slept for over 6 hours and woke up refreshed.",A380,Solo Leisure,First Class,LHR to HKG,01/03/2016,yes,Verified,1,5,5,5,5,4,5
very quick and efficient,David Taylor,20/04/2016,United Kingdom,"  London Heathrow - Nairobi Kenya. Boeing 777 not new but clean. Departed on time. Food was very average and was served at 11.30 am as a ""lunch"" - bland and uninteresting. Cabin crew very quick and efficient but then ran away for most of the flight so that they could get the service over as quickly as possible. An hour before landing they reappeared again with cardboard boxes with a chicken sandwich, a drink and that was it. You sometimes wonder whether British Airways check the quality of the offers made by other airlines or whether it is just customer loyalty that keeps them flying. Nairobi arrival was a nightmare as my electronic visa had a page not dowloaded and this resulted in an extra hour and a half with immigration before it was sorted out.",Boeing 777,Business,Economy Class,LHR to NBO,01/04/2016,no,Verified,3,3,2,2,2,2,2
food was average,David Taylor,20/04/2016,United Kingdom,"  Left Nairobi more or less on time-had to wait for a thunderstorm to pass before take off. Premium Economy seat is better than Economy in that there is more leg room. Flight was packed and the 777 was subdivided into First, Club, Business, Premium Economy and Economy - not sure whether all these subdivisions are really necessary - it would have been better to provide customers with a more modern/newer aircraft instead of an older 777 with all these seating alternatives that look rather dated. Food was average, choice between ""grilled steak"" and chicken and a vegetable salad starter and dried out cake as a dessert. Cabin crew efficient but hardly any warmer than the food, they seemed to want to get the meal out of the way as quickly as possible. It was a night flight and they disappeared until 1 hour before landing when the dreaded cardboard box appeared pretending to be breakfast - a pot of yoghurt and a dreadful, dry cereal bar. Arrived on time and immediately went for a coffee and a snack at the airport-which of course should have been served as a breakfast on the flight. British Airways needs to wake up and check what other airlines offer on the same flight.",Boeing 777,Business,Premium Economy,NBO to LHR,01/04/2016,no,Verified,9,3,2,2,3,2,3
the service is good,57 reviews,13/04/2016,China,"  Flew London to Beijing with British Airways. The flight leaves from Heathrow Terminal 5, normally Beijing flight leaves from B Gates, so I made myself comfortable at the B Gate lounge which is 100 times better than the two A Gate congested lounges before the flight. It was a good flight and day flights are more comfortable, though quite full. The BA Club seats are configured 8 across and the seat is not as wide as competitor's, but just enough. CX may have better seat but BA sometime offers good value. The service is good. It has a Chinese crew and unlike with Cathay, the crew are always the same on this route (because they are based in China specifically for the London route), so a frequent flyer may be recognized and get treated better. It was an on time flight.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,LHR to PEK,01/02/2016,yes,Verified,1,4,4,4,3,4,3
food was above average,S Davis,13/04/2016,Canada,"  This was my second time flying with British Airways and this particular route from Vancouver to Paris CDG via London Heathrow. Round trip was overall on time without delay. Online check in was easy and got to pick out the seats I wanted. Picked up the boarding passes at the airport without any problems. The food was above average and the cabin crew were courteous and professional. Drinks were frequently served or could be picked up from the galley independently. Washrooms were clean. Overall a satisfactory experience. However, one thing almost all travellers on the YVR-LHR route will notice is the age of this aircraft. I think it should be replaced soon, since this is a very popular route. I flew in late March and return beginning of April, being low season but the cabin was still full. I think this flight deserves a newer aircraft like the A380. Particularly, the back of the seats are very thin and one can feel every scratching movement if the person behind tries to retrieve items from the front pocket. The in-flight entertainment system is also very out dated, pictures were not clear and colours were rather misleading.",Boeing 747,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YVR to CDG via LHR,01/04/2016,yes,Verified,1,2,5,5,5,5,2
the flight was satisfactory,57 reviews,12/04/2016,China,"  Hong Kong to London with British Airways. I normally prefer aisle seats for long haul but this flight I chose a window seat, because it was an A380 flight on the upper deck. The upper deck situation means that I can take advantage of a window side drawer where apart from easy storage I can also put something on top. And Premium Economy offers just enough space to move out if needed. BA's Premium Economy service is good, the food is not the same for economy as in the case of some airlines, and the seat acceptably comfortable. BA is generous on alcoholic drinks though I do not take advantage of it. But the food is not very good. All in all the flight was satisfactory.",A380,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,HKG to LHR,01/03/2016,yes,Verified,7,4,4,3,3,5,3

treat myself to premium economy,8 reviews,12/04/2016,United Kingdom,"  I decided to treat myself to British Airways premium economy from Beijing to London, which was not much more expensive than economy. I had a bulkhead seat which meant I had plenty of legroom and could stretch out on the flight. The cabin looked a bit tired but the staff were friendly and professional and I was comfortable. The food was quite good but a glass of champagne when we boarded would have been nice.

made me check in the trolley ,Raphael Goossens,08/04/2016,Belgium,"  Riyadh to Dusseldorf via Heathrow with British Airways. Check in at Riyadh was terrible, broken baggage belts and staff explaining to passangers that there is an issue instead of fixing it. Flight to LHR was smooth and with good service. LHR however was a disaster. Priority Security took forever and the gate agent was even worse. I have a trolley and handluggage as specified. First she started complaining about the trolley - surprise it was within size - then she looked at my laptop case which was 1 cm too large and made me check in the trolley - worst of all was her attitude in this. I feel that her customer bashing behavior definitely did not comply with the BA image and expectations from businesses class passengers.

used to be better than this,Mark McCullough,07/04/2016,United Kingdom,"  British Airways used to be better than this. I spent all afternoon in the Business lounge, waiting for my Gatwick flight at 7pm. My boarding card said the gate closed at 1840, and when I hadn't heard any announcement by 1830 I asked the BA man at reception if there was a delay. I was very dismayed when he casually said ""yes, about 1 hour 30 mins"". I was very unhappy they had not told us earlier, or asked if we needed help getting home in a more timely manner. There was a time when BA would have tried to reroute its premium passengers, but this man told me his duty manager had specifically told him not to do this. He told me that if I wanted to switch to an earlier LHR or LCY flight I would have to go back landside and buy a ticket for those flights. Onboard I had my first experience of BA's new club Europe, wherein the middle seat is covered by a tray, to give the perception of more space, without actually giving you a wider seat or more legroom. From my experiences of BA business class in both long and short haul, over the past year, it is very sad to see that BA is focussing on making changes which make it more money, rather than changes which benefit the passenger experience. My meal was plonked down in front of me without telling me what it was, and it wasn't at all tasty. But a stewardess gave me great customer service by giving me a plastic glass to decant my bloody mary into, so that I could hold on to it on approach to LGW.

pre-allocated me a middle seat,Mark McCullough,06/04/2016,United Kingdom,"  It is very irritating that British Airways pre-allocated me a middle seat, which I was not allowed to change when checking in online unless I paid 9 pounds. At the airport self service check in would not let me change seat either, so I had to find a customer service desk to get my preferred window seat, a waste of my time and theirs. The short flight from London Gatwick to Amsterdam was ok, flight crew spoke to the cabin a few times, which I appreciate. But cabin crew clearly wished they were somewhere else.

If anyone has flown British Airways Club Europe, you'll realise it's the same seat as their economy class EuroTraveller with a seat made into a divider in the middle. As I was flying from Gatwick, the BA lounge was under refurbishment and was directed into No 1. lounge which was quite packed already. When I got to Rome, my baggage was lost. To make matters worse, the counter for lost baggage which operates on behalf of British Airways was very poorly marked. There was no sign or logo of British Airways. It was manned by two person which hadn't had a clue what was going on and would only assist in filling up the forms. To make matters worse, they were talking to each other leaving my partner and I just awkwardly staring at them to complete their conversation.

absurd cost-cutting measure,B Wijesinghe,01/04/2016,United States,"  Washington to Dubai return via Heathrow, on British Airways.  Outbound segment on an A380 and three others on refurbished B747-400 aircraft.  As a regular 20-year customer and a Gold level Executive Club member, one has to expect much variation in the BA onboard product. Staff are generally polite and hardworking, some are not very well trained, so seem to lack the extra attention to detail that should come with Club World. The fish main course served between IAD and LHR was unbelievably bad, but other meals were fairly good. High Tea without scones, clotted cream and strawberry jam is an absurd cost-cutting measure on a British airline, as I discovered on the LHR-IAD sector.

I was impressed by the size of both meals (lunch and hot breakfast). The only real let down was the seat. It was tiny (so narrow) and I felt quite squashed in by it.

overall experience was pleasant,J Lawrence,23/03/2016,South Africa,"  British Airways from Seattle to Johannesburg via London Heathrow. First leg SEA to LHR was on a 747. The plane was satisfactory to me. I don't understand the comments from people who think the 747 is tired or worn out. Not a bad ride in economy when the person in front of you doesn't recline their seat. I sat in one of the ""twosomes"" (seat 52A) in the tail. The food on this leg was bland, the continental breakfast was a disappointment. I would buy seat 52A again if I was traveling on a British Airways 747, but be advised there is no wall next to 52A that you can lean on to sleep. Second leg was on an A380. I sat in the tail of the upper deck in seat 82A. This time, the young woman in front of me reclined to the maximum as soon as she could and kept her seat that way the entire 11+ hours of the flight. The A380 is a very nice plane and the overall experience was pleasant despite extensive turbulence the majority of the way. The upper cabin on an A380 is amazingly quiet. The food on this leg was far better with an English breakfast served prior to landing in Jo-burg. I would not play for seat 82A again because there are two boxes under the seat in front of 82A that limit foot room, but I would play for seat 82B, which is an aisle seat. IFE on both legs was pretty sad but I'm not one for popular culture. Cabin attendants on both legs were polite and did a very nice job. BA ground personnel at Heathrow were very nice and helpful. I've traveled between South Africa and North America about a dozen times over the past two years.
