# Tableau-BritishAirwaysDashboard
Given that I am completing a tutorial series of data analytics dashboards by various authors on YouTube, and my objective is to review, potentially include in my portfolio, and write a Medium story about these top dashboard tutorials, I have chosen to do an individual repository for each project and a combined one approach. The reasons are as follows.
### Individual Repository:
* Organization: I will create individual repositories for each tutorial to maintain a clear organization.
* Specific Feedback: I can provide specific feedback and insights for each tutorial in its dedicated repository, making it easier for users to find information related to a particular video.
### Combined Repository:
* Project Overview: I am able to maintain a combined repository that serves as an overarching project, summarizing your experience across all tutorials.
* Portfolio Inclusion: If I plan to showcase a completed tutorial in your portfolio, a combined repository will provide a holistic view of my dashboard creation skills.
This approach allows me to have the best of both worlds, providing dedicated spaces for detailed feedback on each tutorial while offering an overall project summary in a single repository. It also aligns well with my goal of creating a Medium story about my top dashboard tutorials, as you can reference both the individual repositories and the overarching project in your storytelling.

## Project Overview
Embark on a hands-on journey with me as I delve into five succinct YouTube video tutorials, each designed to be completed in 45 minutes or less. This immersive exercise aims to assess the accessibility and user-friendliness of dashboard creation tools by following along with diverse tutorials. From mastering data visualization to crafting interactive dashboards, the goal is to gauge the efficiency of each tutorial and the overall experience in completing the projects. Join me on this exploration as I share insights, challenges, and triumphs in the realm of dashboard creation. The GitHub Readme will serve as a comprehensive guide, offering a glimpse into the world of quick and practical tutorials, providing both newcomers and seasoned users with valuable perspectives on the ease of implementation for each tutorial and the project as a whole.
